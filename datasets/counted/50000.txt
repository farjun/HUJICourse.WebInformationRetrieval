review/summary: Nice collection of Julie Strain images
review/text: This is only for Julie Strain fans. It's a collection of her photos -- about 80 pages worth with a nice section of paintings by Olivia.If you're looking for heavy literary content, this isn't the place to find it -- there's only about 2 pages with text and everything else is photos.Bottom line: if you only want one book, the Six Foot One ... is probably a better choice, however, if you like Julie like I like Julie, you won't go wrong on this one either.

review/summary: Really Enjoyed It
review/text: I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.

review/summary: Essential for every personal and Public Library
review/text: If people become the books they read and if "the child is father to the man," then Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is the most influential author, poet, and artist of modern times. For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, "the other sides of Dr. Seuss" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a "must buy" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon.

review/summary: Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment
review/text: Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E. Perry of Nolensville, Tennessee, is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house.

review/summary: Good academic overview
review/text: Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to "cash in" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man.

review/summary: One of America's greatest creative talents
review/text: "Dr. Seuss: American Icon" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term "energetic cartoon surrealism" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the "Disneyification" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes "threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents.

review/text: Theodor Seuss Giesel was best known as 'Dr. Seuss', one of the most influential and enduringly popular children's authors of the 20th century. Giesel created not only his famous imaginative picturebooks, but a unique art and poetry, and even a place for himself in politics. Philip Nel argues that these added activities make Dr. Seuss one of the most influential people in America - certainly the most influential poet - and Dr. Seuss: American Icon provides the reader an memorably excellent survey of Dr. Seuss' many achievements.

review/summary: Academia At It's Best
review/text: When I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas my first impression went along these line: "Oh great some professor who probably wrote alot of mumbo-jumbo that I don't want to know about Dr. Suess and I know it won't be an enjoyable read."Thanks goodness I read it nonetheless.To my pleasure, Nel hardly writes in the airy academia style with which I expected him to. In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. "Dr. Seuss: American Icon" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Fascinating account of a genius at work
review/text: As far as I am aware, this is the first book-length study of the work of Dr. Seuss, and Philip Nel has done an excellent job. If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don't believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics. Secondly, the dust jacket on my copy was a little loose.

review/text: I just finished the book, &quot;Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,&quot; by David Ray, an outstanding resource for small church pastors, as is his other book, &quot;The Big Small Church Book.&quot; I will be rereading both regularly and referring to them often. I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more.

review/summary: Not Just for Pastors!
review/text: I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!

review/summary: Small church pastor? This is the book on worship
review/text: I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the "Thou Shalts" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!

review/summary: not good
review/text: I bought this book because I read some glowing praise on an online library site. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed by page three. I always buy books in the hope and expectation of having an enjoyable read, not to criticise. However, this book is in urgent need of good editing -- though quite possibly editing alone wouldn't save it. Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three. It is quite possible that the storyline is deeply moving. I'll never know because I can't bring myself to continue. Sorry.

review/text: I have to admit, I am not one to write reviews on book. I do however like to read them. Some of the reviews are great, some are cruel, but the reviews on this book were absolutlely hysterical. I read this book and after watching the war of the words I couldn't help, but to jump in. I am on the good side of the book. I loved how it kept my intersted. On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the "Traveling librarian" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game. Maybe it is someone who dislikes the author for personal reasons, that has posted more then one awful review, or maybe this is another who is jealous, Who knows? All I know is that I liked the book, and future readers take the advice of the ignorant with a grain of salt.

Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book? Obviously not many because you all have way too much time on your hands. I liked the book, and remember that those of you in glass houses should not throw stones.

review/summary: Loved it !!
review/text: I loved this book for a few reasons. The first was that I felt as if I was not reading the story, but I was part of the story. I loved the way it twisted and turned at every corner, I loved that I simply did not know what to expect. The choice of words was spectacular and just when I thought that I was in control of my own emotions, something would jump up and surprise me. I am anxiously waiting for the next book, this was one of the best romance suspense books that I have read in years. I highly recomend it. I give this one five stars !!!!!!!!

review/summary: A FIVE STAR BOOK
review/text: I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!

review/summary: The truth about WOTWS
review/text: I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !!

review/text: Just as predicted the first chapter of the book was long. I continued reading and then fell in love with WOTWS. It is heart warming and realistic. I thought it was a little depressing, but I quickly realized the writers point. There is a rainbow at the end of each storm. I did notice the error on the cover, but it only made me love the writer more. This writer is talented and she is not corporate, nor does it appear that she has a staff working for her. Her book was writen from the heart and that is what makes an American literary legend. I would rather read a book with an error then to read hollow perfection any day of the week.

A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.

As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a "lean" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!

review/summary: You've got to hand it to the author...
review/text: I purchased this book after reading rave reviews of it included within a review of a really good book I'd read. Apparently, the author (or her friends and family) are placing reviews of good books and encouraging people to buy this book if you liked the one they were reviewing. Great marketing by the author. However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler. It is a self-published, self-edited (and extremely poorly edited, I might add), and self-promoted lame excuse for a novel. My eyes rolled constantly while reading this book. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did. The best part of this book is the short length. There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon. I really feel duped for purchasing this book after reading about it in Amazon's readers' reviews. Don't waste your money. The author should have printed only enough copies for family and friends. The rest of the population should be spared having to read this drivel.

review/summary: You've got to be kidding!
review/text: It has been years since I've read a romance novel. If this is typical of the genre these days, I will never pick up another one. Not only is the plot contrived and juvenile, the writing shows the lack of skill expected only in a child's writing. Many of my seventh grade writing students would be embarrassed if this trash was attributed to them. "The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him." Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction. Perhaps by the time she graduates from college she will have gained an understanding of good sentence construction, proper punctuation, and the value of using adjectives sparingly. And if she reads a great deal along the way, she might also learn how to construct a plausible plot.

review/summary: awful beyond belief
review/text: I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the "wicked saints" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on "other reviews" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned!

review/summary: interplay of traditions across Caribbean
review/text: from publisher:Addresses the interplay of diverse spiritual, religious, and cultural traditions across the Caribbean.Dealing with the ongoing interaction of rich and diverse cultural traditions from Cuba and Jamaica to Guyana and Surinam, Nation Dance addresses some of the major contemporary issues in the study of Caribbean religion and identity. The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of "nations" across the waters.

review/summary: Ecclesiological Milestone
review/text: With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled "The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology," deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase "kingdom of God" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the "rock" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to "the gates of Hades will not prevail" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, "The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church," Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, "people of God," "body of Christ," and "community of the Spirit." A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, "The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership." Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: "Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God" (pg. 170); "Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord" (pg. 180); and, "Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, "The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. "The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, "The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life." In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder.

review/summary: Early Christian development of the Church
review/text: Everett Ferguson approaches the subject of early christian development with quotes from their early documents in their own words. Ferguson gives us a peek into the minds of early Christians and puts it together in a form one can understand today. The only criticism is that he can get too technical and detailed at times. With patience his writing is able to be followed by a serious student of the subject of God's church. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of the subject!

review/summary: A miracle on every page!
review/text: Who was Saint Hyacinth? The story starts with a chance meeting in Rome where he witnesses (the future) Saint Dominic raising a man from death. From that point the book is one miracle and amazing encounter on Hyacinth's journey across North Europe. He raised the dead, walks on water, fled the invading Tatars from a Cathedral carrying a 500 lb. Statue. All thoughout he dispenses his own brand of spiruatilty and humility. The book reads liks a combination of a self help book like the One minute Manager and the excitement of the Raiders of the Lost Arc. Kids will love this book to be read to them. They will never forget Saint Hyacinth. I know I never will.

review/summary: Wardell's book is a pure delight.
review/text: Steven Wardell's book is a pure delight and I've recommended itto friends of all ages. In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's &quot;Generation X&quot;. Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values. The Ando family members are wonderful, memorable people and Stevern Wardell writes poignantly about their lives and hopes of each of them.

review/summary: A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens
review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the &quot;New Young&quot; of Japan seem to be creating an &quot;international&quot; blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!

review/summary: Almost a day by day view
review/text: Steven Wardell went to Japan without reading any of the hundreds of books about Japan. He went without any idea of how Japan would treat him. So what he writes seems to come to us without much editing by any pre-made belief. No filters are between us and the experiences he had day to day. All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn't even speak English good, end of quote. Couldn't even speak English GOOD? Neither can the exchange students it seems.All in all, you need to get it. Used, paperback, in hardcover, any version you can. Just get it.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This is an excellent book. It offers the opinions of a diverse sample of real Muslim Women with very different attitudes. It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular.

review/text: I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but "more than equal." Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen

review/text: Although written with script authors et al in mind, Dramatica for Screenwriters is the perfect companion book for Dramatica: A New Theory of Story.Using witty and easy to understand examples, the author takes you systematically through the process of turning a meager idea into a full-blown, grand argument story via Dramatica Theory definitions. With a slight mental adjustment, the tips and advice in this book fit the novelist's dilemma as well as the screenwriter's. If you are exploring the world of Dramatica, you need this book on your shelf.

review/text: Sorry for any mistake I could do here, English is not my first language.While Dramatica is a powerful tool for building a story, it is complex and sometimes overwhelming. Armando Salda&ntilde;a-Mora found a way to demystify Dramatica and give a lot of practical advices and principles for creating a story with Dramatica."Dramatica for Screenwriters" is easy to understand, fun and thought-provoking. The only drawback is that this book is not useful if you do not know the Dramatica Theory or do not use Dramatica software. Now, if you're a Dramatica user or if you plan to seriously evaluate the software, it is a must-have.

review/summary: Thoroughly Confusing
review/text: I purchased this book based on the other reviews claiming that it "demystifies" the Dramatica theory and software. Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it ("Dramatica: A New Theory of Story") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for "Dramatica For Screenwriters", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place. So the reader is left with a bit of a Catch-22: if you need the book, you probably won't understand it, and if you can understand the book, you probably don't need it.

review/summary: Practical Guide to a Complicated Process
review/text: Dramatica is a pain in the ass to learn. The main book is dense, repetitive, dilatory and slow. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS is the opposite! The writing flows easily. It's directs you to the easiest possible paths for getting started. It encourages you to take action and walks you through it. It provides good theoretical guidance without getting bogged down.This is the book that should come with the software for everyone, not just screenwriters. It gives anyone who reads it the ability to jump into A STORY and get it done. Once you've gotten A STORY done you can use Dramatica to alter it for it's media (you may need the main book to get you there). You can also get more stories done with it. Dramatica is not intuitive software. You need to use it from a number of angles to get the hang of it. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS gets you there. The main Dramatica book doesn't. READ THIS BOOK FIRST.

review/summary: Even as a fiction writer, I found this book invaluable
review/text: I think the hardest thing for people coming to Dramatica the first time is understanding that the theory and software are not designed to write your story for you (or tell you what your story is about), but rather to tell you, based on the way you answer all the hundreds of questions, what the best storyform or context is from which to tell your story in the way you want.[...]I did the work to know the theory, but "Dramatica for Screenwriters" really helped me understand it. Even though I am a fiction writer and not a screenwriter, I found that most of this book applies to any kind of fictional world building. I highly recommend it.Don't buy the book thinking it's going to take the place of doing the work of getting to know the theory. It assumes prior knowledge.

review/summary: Good structure makes good bones for story
review/text: Beauty is in the bones. This book gives your story good bones, and you end up knowing why. It is a clear explanation of how to do the structure of a story so the end product is a top model. You have to supply the writing, a big commitment, but you won't have the feeling when you're done that something is incomplete or wrong - and all your work goes to something which misses the mark.We have all seen too many movies where the verdict is "Interesting!" To a writer, this is deadly. It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty.

review/text: Not much I can say about this book... It's full of VVVery difficult number puzzles... at least for me. Okay, so I don't get 'A's for my grades at school, but I think that even you might find it a little difficult. The way I see it, you will need lots of paper, patience and time, say 30 minutes or so to solve even the easiest of these.Why? Because basically, you are asked how many combinations can be formed from such and such. Example: How many ways get 31241 by adding prime numbers only? This is not really what the problems are like in the book, they are far more complicated than that.For me, it's just too much. I can't even do 1 single problem. I can't even look up the answers because uses some sort of a legend that I can't understand. But if you have an above average intelligence or are mathematically gifted, you will probably find some obscure short cut to the problem a la Gauss. For the rest, forget it.Word of warning: these are purely number problems. I can't tell if logic will help or even plays a part in this book, but the problems are NUMBER problems.

The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print. That said, the actual content is very comprehensive. One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm. Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing.

There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field.

review/summary: No &quot;Insider&quot; Secrets
review/text: If you are someone who is fairly new to the law school admissions process and haven't done much research on what it takes to get into law school, this information might seem very helpful and insightful to you. However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide.

review/summary: Not an "ultimate guide"
review/text: Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.

review/summary: Everything my advisor SHOULD have told me!
review/text: My advisor never asked any of the right questions or gave me the kind of information that would have helped me with my plan to study law. While looking for books on the LSAT I found this book and it really helped. It told me everything that the best advisor would have told me. It really helped me evaluate how I felt about law school and how to properly prepare myself. The last time I went back to my advisor he was shocked at how much I knew. I feel really good about my applications and think I have a really good chance of getting a "big envelope".

review/summary: Exactly what I needed.
review/text: This book answered all my questions about getting into law school in a plain and straightforward way. It was easy to read, and clear in its explanations. It even answered many questions I hadn't even thought to ask. The stories that are included in its &quot;Tales From the Trenches&quot; are really interesting, sometimes funny, and really help you to know how to avoid mistakes you might otherwise make. It's much more help than any other source I have found. The only thing it doesn't do is have a full LSAT prep course, but it does give you examples of the questions, and tells you how you can structure your own preparation program. Buying this book actually saved me money by helping me choose only to the right law schools for me, and by giving me a way to evaluate LSAT courses.(It turns out that a lot of expensive courses are not as good as you might think!) The appendix alone is worth the cost of the book. It has information on all the law schools sorted by the &quot;15 Essential Factors&quot; for picking law schools as they are outlined in the book. It makes it easier to sort through all the schools to find the right ones to apply to. This book really gave me confidence that I will get into law school. I can't wait to get my &quot;big envelopes&quot;!

review/summary: THIS BOOK SAVED ME OVER $100,000.00!!!
review/text: Boy am I lucky to have found The Ultimate Guide to Law School Admission. I picked it up because a friend recommended it to me as being the best book for the law school application process, and was she right! When I got the book I skipped right to the chapters on the admission process and found the whole thing very informative and encouraging. It let me know that even though I'm not the best student, there are plenty of schools that I would definitly get in to, and it told me how to make my application the best it could possibly be. I am sure that I would have gotten into at least a couple of the schools I had picked to apply to. However, lucky for me, before I sent in my applications I decided to read the book again. This time I started with the first chapter &quot;Should I go to law school.&quot; Guess what? Being a lawyer isn't what I thought it was! I mean, this book told me things about what lawyers personal lives are like, and what their average work day is like... stuff that I had never gotten anywhere else! This chapter convinced me that I would not be happy being a lawyer! Not only did this chapter save me from the expensive application fees... it saved me from spending the next three years wasting my time, and tuition money, pursuing a degree that would have put me in a job that apparently isn't right for me at all! Thank you Mrs. Wright, you saved me $100,000.00! I definitly recommend that EVERYONE read this chapter first! Don't go to law school without it!!!

review/summary: Great treatment of the defeat of reticence by exposure
review/text: Using a quiet, restrained writing style that is a pure pleasure to read, Gurstein chronicles the one-sided battle between the party of exposure and the party of reticence. She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language. Take a summer afternoon (or two) to read this euphonious essay for a refreshing breather from the cacophony of Howard Stern, Don Imus, and their local knock-offs; follow-up news stories on Viagra; Judge Judy; infomercials; network news; and the culture of money, sex, power, and fame hustled by the print and electronic media.

The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1.

review/summary: A must read for anyone with blood pressure issues
review/text: Books by Dr Kenneth Cooper have been a tremendous source of guidance for me for over 30 years.When I first started being affected by the stress side effects of working too hard and too long in the 70's I started exercising. At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book "Aerobics" (a term he coined), then to "Aerobics Program for total Well Being...", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book "Start Strong, Finish Strong" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading.

review/summary: Real Alaskan Sourdough
review/text: Ruth Allman has written an excellent book about Alaskan sourdough history and provided very tasty receipes. As a resident of Kodiak,Alaska I have been lucky enough to get some of Ruth Allmans sourdough starter. I have tried her receipes and all I can say is , wow! San Francisco look out. You get a real sense of the struggle of the pioneers with this book, and the way she describs the receipes, you can just imagine spreading the butter and jam on the bread. My favorite receipe is the hot griddle cakes with fresh strawberries. As Ruth says, the art of mixing the batter with air, and the timing of slopping it on the grill is a skill learned over time. The Baked Alaska with sourdough waffles (which by the way is how it was actually first made) is a dessert from heaven. This is a book that every sourdough making Alaskan owns.

review/summary: Cheechako to Sourdough in 190 Pages
review/text: My poor dogeared, stained copy of this book came to me by way of my dad and brother after their trip to Alaska in 1989. Dad acquired some starter in about 1959 that its guardian said had been going since the days of the 49ers. I know it's been bubbling since then. All Dad made, though, were bread and rubbery pancakes. He, unfortunately, didn't buy a copy for himself, although I'd give anything to have him make another meal of them! You see, that's the magic of sourdough, the romance, the stories, the memories! I've not yet been to Alaska, but Ruth Allman has taken me from Cheechako to Sourdough by generously sharing her recipes and her stories with me. I read this book just for the enjoyment of it sometimes. We had her waffles this morning. I made her Flower Rolls recipe into Danish rolls for my famously fussy father-in-law. What better tribute could I make to this cook and her book than to say that he loved them! My two year old son and I will make a little fire in the woods and bake a sourdough version of bannock in Dad's old Dutch oven this week and make some memories of our own.

review/summary: Cannot recommend
review/text: As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must.

review/summary: The best sourdough book around
review/text: For those of us who would prefer to use sourdough starter as the sole leavening agent in making breads, this cookbook is very helpful in getting us "started". There are some receipts calling for the addition of yeast, and baking soda is often added not so much to leaven loaves as to create a chemical change which dampens some of the sourness in a very sour pot of starter. Overall, this book gives some of the best history of sourdough from a lady who knows first-hand the importance of an active sourdough starter, and will get any beginner started off making some very good breads, rolls, breakfast items & desserts. There is even a section at the end for making various products from the wild berries grown in the Last Frontier (for those of us who are able to utilize lingonberries & such)! Even for those who don't care to do a lot of baking, this book has a great deal of interesting information about Alaska & its pioneers - a great read for celebrating our 50th year of Statehood!

review/summary: A Bit of Heaven
review/text: I got this book because of all the interesting stories and sourdough tidbits that it contained. The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled "sour cream sour" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn't want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven't had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, "It is a slice of Heaven!". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting. It made the best bread we have ever eaten and now I can't wait to try some of the other recipes in the book. Four thumbs up.

review/summary: Imprecise Recipes Make Bad Bread
review/text: It's quaint, I'll give it that. The handwritten style and illustrations are reminiscent of, perhaps, an early scratch draft of "The Moosewood" done with a sharpie instead of a nib and ink. But the recipes for bread are poorly assembled.Any bread maker knows how the proportionality of ingredients is key for bread. I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don't expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast? The kinds in this book!I'm not claiming to be an expert on bread, but I've made two loaves a week for 2 years now, with a lot of success with other cookbooks (America's Bread Book, The Bread Book, My Bread); I think this one is lame. I'm glad it's my housemate's and that I didn't pay for it.

This book is as much fun just to read as it is to cook from. Full of Alaskan lore, great recipes, and if you are into sourdough, or think you might be, this may be the only recipe book you'll ever need for just plain family eating: breads, biscuits, hot cakes, waffles, and anecdotes.

review/summary: Enjoyed Ruth's Sourdough pancakes when she served them.
review/text: I toured the House of Wickersham in Juneau Alaska years ago. After the tour, Ruth Allman served everyone Sourdough pancakes with her Rose Hip syrup. After such a delicious treat, I bought a copy of her book. I have a 1976 first edition. It has had a lot of use and that use is showing. In a few years, I will have to get another, later edition of this book.It is the best sourdough cooking book I have, and the stories she tells of "Life on the Last Frontier" only add to the book. Her father, Judge Wickersham, was one of the first territorial judges and first territorial governors of Alaska, having served in these positions shortly after President Lincoln purchased Alaska from Russia. Ruth weaves stories her father told her, throughout her book. Ruth and her husband Jack Allman, lived many years as Alaska Pioneers, and had to survive on their sourdough pot. From those days comes many of Ruth's receipes.My only regret is that I did not have Ruth Allman autograph my copy.

review/summary: The Best Sourdough Starter for Bread & Hot Cakes
review/text: I had an excellent sourdough starter from a friend in Alaska. Debbie lived on the 49 Mile River. During the winter they, Debbie & Brad made bent wood furinture to sell in a general store in Dawson. Then pan for gold in the summer. Sourdough bread & hot cakes was a staple of life for them living in such a remote location.Ruth Allman's, "Alaska Sourdough" cook book is an excellent primer in making a sourdough "starter" from scratch,(just in case you can't get a start from a friend) the proper care for your starter, and how to rejuveniate the starter when needed. We are very selective who we share our sourdough bread & rolls with. We don't want to be depended upon to provide bakery items all the time.We made our purchase from redtree15 on Amazon Marketplace. We really appreciate the service provided.

review/summary: Not your quick refrence cookbook
review/text: After having a chance to read through the book I am not sure I would have bothered purchasing it in a store. The "sourdough lore" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more "authentically old" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don't know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can't cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don't have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick! There are about 10,000 things she recommends doing with waffles but these are not unique recipes - these are tips, hints, and VARIATIONS. Cover waffles with ice cream, meringue, pancakes, ham, make them a sandwich, cook them with curry and dip them in fish paste. YUCKO!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: This is Such a great book! I have a sourdough starter from a friend and this book shows you how to care for it along with wonderful recipes. There are so many great stories that even without the recipes it would be a great book. I love the muffins, they don't taste like sourdough at all! I will say that if you don't know how to bake bread you should get another book along with it. I would recommend "Beard on Bread." Don't trust him for sourdough, he dose not like it. His recipe for sourdough calls for milk with Ruth Allman says causes spoilage.

review/text: As a recipe book, this isn't all that great. The waffles are pretty good and the biscuits are enjoyable (especially with some whole wheat flour mixed in), but overall there aren't that many recipes.I enjoyed the writing style and anecdotes, but I was hoping for more recipes.On the positive side, the author does not make the reader feel that using sourdough is difficult or mysterious, but makes it attainable for the novice.

When it arrived a few days later, the fun began! We made buscuits, pancakes, bread, bread sticks and are still going strong. I keep several buscuits in the fridge for quick snacks. Pop one or two in the microwave and douse with butter.The sourdough is very flavorable and easy to regenerate.I would recommend this product to anyone who has a taste for sourdough products...

review/summary: Sourdough...Alaska style
review/text: Frankly, "Alaska Sourdough" will not suit everyone's tastes. Don't get me wrong, "Alaska Sourdough" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from "on the trail" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers."Alaska Sourdough" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of "Alaska Sourdough" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation.

review/summary: Robert Kane's *The Oxford Handbook on Free Will*
review/text: Do you want to brought up to speed on the state of the art in philosophical discussions of free will? Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book.

review/summary: Oxford and Kane have done it again!
review/text: So far forth, the editors of the Oxford Handbook series have managed to put together products which both the neophyte and the fully-informed scholar will find beneficial. Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended.

review/summary: Kane's Compilation Will Leave You Proud To Lose An Argument
review/text: I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P. Erickson, M.D.christianerickson@alumni.duke.edu

Rick's books are excellent for more in-depth visits, but this is great for first-timers trying to figure it all out.

review/summary: The Travelers Companion
review/text: I admit it: I'm addicted to travel. My wife and I are semi-retired and we are on the go half the year. We travel for our home-based business, "The Nurses Choice" which cover 50 metro areas and therefore must visit a variety of cities. We then decided to expand overseas.Having to plan for a trip to Europe, we searched for a guide that would provide what we needed. The "Eyewitness Travel Guides" offered a total package. Good maps, photos, recommended places to see, dine, and stay. It's well-organized and relatively small. We brought it on the tours of France and Italy. It served us well, allowing us to find and decide what to see fairly readily. A friend just borrowed it and they said the same thing. It really aided their decisions and provided a reliable course of action. We plan to buy the other series for other locations. That should speak for itself.

review/summary: A Superlative Planning Aide and Top-level Guide
review/text: This book was tailor made for our trip, which was for 3 weeks, hitting 8 major cities. It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for "getting our heads in the game" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn't get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven't decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn't buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don't see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can't fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn't cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven't started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!

review/summary: Good Overall Idea
review/text: I really like the eyewitness guides, I have seven including "Europe". All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more "popular" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each.

review/summary: nice eye candy, but not as handy as the other guides
review/text: The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides. The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is. I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide.

review/summary: Colourful Digest Of Places To See In Europe
review/text: I bought this book to help me plan my trip to Europe and it was so useful, it was the only book I packed to take on my trip. The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the "tiny" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn't judge how "good" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you.

review/summary: Going to Europe? Get this book!
review/text: If you're already a fan of the Eyewitness Travel Guide series, you know what to expect from this book. If this is your first time, let me tell you you'll be amazed with how great and how useful this book is.This particular guide summarizes the contents of over 20 other books by DK, including information for 20 countries in total, organized in the following way:- The British Isles (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)- France and the low countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg &amp; The Netherlands)- The Iberian Peninsula (Spain &amp; Portugal)- Italy and Greece- Germany, Austria and Switzerland- Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark &amp; Finland)- Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary &amp; Poland).This guide contains, for every country, information regarding sites to visit, hotels, restaurants, shopping, museums, travel info (how tos for travelling by train, bus, car, metro, etc). Worthy of notice are their trademark cutaways of castles and churches, maps and street-by-street graphics.The only drawback is that since it includes information on so many countries, some of it might not have the detail you'd expect. For example, the France section has only 73 pages, while the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris (another book from DK) has over 350 pages on Paris alone!A phenomenal guide if you're planning on visiting many countries on one trip, but if you intend to dedicate more time to just a couple, you'd be better off getting the specific country/city guides.

review/summary: The Major Sights in Twenty Countries - Amazing!
review/text: Yes, this is one heavy book. It is more than likely not a guide you want to carry around with you unless you intend to lose a few pounds from the extra weight in your backpack. Otherwise, it is quite a great guide for deciding where you want to take your next vacation in Europe. It is filled with color photography, illustrations and details you wil enjoy reading. It is graphically exciting and visually pleasing. Of all the guides I've seen, the Eyewitness Travel Guides are sheer brillance.On the inside cover there is a map of Europe and then the pages are color coded so you can find the following countries: Great Britian, Ireland, France, Belgium & Luxembourge, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.So, if you wanted to find the information on France, you just turn the book sideways and look for the yellow markings on the pages. Viola, you are there. If you are dreaming about visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or want to go see the Hall of Mirrors at the Chateau de Versailles, may I say...they are worth a plane ticket to France. Finding a bottle of Huile D' Olive in the South of France is also something you won't soon forget.There is also a guide to Europe's Rail Network and the Index is perfect.After you look through the main spots to visit in each country, there is a section filled with practical information: Visa Requirements and customs, tourist information, personal security issues, climate, banking, communications, directory for embassies, travel information like car rental and buses, etc. Then there is a shopping and entertainment. So where do you want to stay? There is a guide giving the hotel ratings and it is divided up by the areas you might enjoy visiting. Then, there is a guide to places to eat. While finding a restaurant just by exploring can be exciting, there is something to be said for a guide. Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go. There is nothing quite like being guided through the most gorgeous cities in Europe.This guide is just the start to many adventures.~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Europe (Eyewitness Travel Guides) by Dan Colwell
review/text: Eyewitness travel guides are splendid and this is not an exception. This is a handy guide to Europe and shows some of the more popular spots to travel to. I was a bit confused that not all countries were included. However, that might be because they picked the places that most people travel to. I personally was a bit disapointed that Romania, Ukraine and other more far eastern european countries were not included. However, still and all, this is an awesome guide for the countries that are included. I love how they show everything instead of just writing and writing like many travel guides do. These are the best guides out there and the many photos make these guides stupendous and astounding and many leagues better then closest competitor.

review/summary: Helpful guide on tours through Europe
review/text: I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the "Museum of Arsenal" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well.

review/summary: The Quick Trip Around Europe!
review/text: This guide is great for an overview of many of the great places in Europe - but I cannot believe anyone would consider using this as their only guide. It should be used to maybe narrow down places to visit- then more comprehensive guides should be used. I have never been a believer in those 1 and 2 days in 18 cities over 3 weeks tours. 1 or 2 days is certainly not enough time to fully appreciate and get to know any city you visit. Furthermore, this guides biggest flaw is in doesn't cover anything in central/eastern europe besides the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary! Where's Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, etc....? Yes, Europe is big but the countries not contained in this guide have so much to offer and certainly should not be overlooked. For example, St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - not mentioned here!Don't rush Europe - relax and enjoy it. Take time to get to know the people and cities. This guide can certainly help to narrow down Europe - but should certainly not be relied upon for extensive info on the many great places.

review/summary: If it's Tuesday it must be Belgium
review/text: This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a &quot;buffet&quot; tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...).

review/summary: Great Guide to Europe!
review/text: I just returned from a two-week tour of Western Europe and this book was simply fantastic. Obviously you can't cover everything you could possibly do in Europe in 800 pages, but this book covered more than many of the other Europe tomes. I had this book and one other with me on my trip and this was the only book I opened the entire journey.The best part about this book was all of the illustrations and color photographs. This book shows you what the other guides only tell you. It's hard to tell what building your looking at if you only have a written description, but with the four color illustrations in this book things are easy to identify and find. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a trip to Europe. (Plus, when you get back from your trip this book can even help you identify all those photographs you took)

review/text: All Europe guides are, of necessity, a selection of the very best things to see and do in that vast continent. No one book could be comprehensive, and all Europe guides are pretty bulky and heavy. But the Eyewitness people have managed to fit an astonishing number of places into 800 pages - and their choices are always exactly right, especially for the first-time visitor. It can be hard to decide whether to go to Antwerp or Bruges or Brussels - if you only have time to go to one city in Belgium - and all the photographs and illustrations in this book, plus the informative descriptions, make it a lot easier to make up your mind. The maps alone, all in color, make it worth buying.

review/summary: Great when assisted by another guide
review/text: This guide is great when considering what sites and places to visit. It covers most any city you might find yourself visiting. It does a great job of describing the sites and the history behind them. Does not help with city transportation. Lightly covers the character of each city. I do enjoy the pictures and diagrams in the book. I highly recommend having another guide book that covers more logistics. I used this book along with Rick Steves Europe 2007. They were great companions to one another. My other complaint is that I am a student with a budget. This book does not cover many (if any) cheap places to eat or sleep. It does tell you which places charge admission, but does not tell you the admission price. It is a great book when accompanied by another (like Lonely Planet or Rick Steves.)

review/summary: The Best Archery Book I've Ever Read!
review/text: Hunting the Hard Way is the best book I have ever read. This book is about the adventures of Howard Hill and others that accompanied him on his hunting trips. Howard Hill used a laminated bamboo longbow that he made in his archery shop. He was an excellent shot with the bow also. He took some amazing shots at animals in this book. The most amazing shot in my opinion was at an elk at over 150 yards! He also went hunting with his bow and arrow.

review/summary: Modern Traditional Point of View
review/text: The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures.

review/text: If you are involved with archery, this book belongs in your library. Howard Hill posessed skills that are nothing short of incredible when it came to hunting and target archery. This book will inspire you to pick up your bow and go out and shoot. It might even inspire someone to but down his compound and pick up a real bow. This book is a compilation of accounts from Howards career that would be written off as fantasy if so many people hadn't witnessed what Howard was able to accomplish with a longbow. Howard attempts to describe making bows and other archery tackle. I wouldn't buy the book for these reasons. There are other sources such as the bowyer's bible series that do a much better job.

review/text: This book is highly suggested for anyone interested in traditional archery. It is very entertaining and a great reference book. I've read it a couple of times and still reread sections from time to time. It gives insight into the way things were before compound bows, carbon fiber arrows, LED peep sights, etc. Heck, laminated wood was a big deal! Besides the exciting hunting stories, I liked the short course on bow and arrow construction.

review/summary: An entertaining panorama on magics and demon
review/text: Seligmann, an artist and a &quot;bibliophiliac&quot; of twentieth century, presents a noteworthy panorama on the roots of magic and ancient beliefs &amp; superstitions in this richly illustrated work. This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge. Seligmann provides us a classified history of magic, beginning with ancient Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan and Greece; then shifts the main route towards the medieaval Europe. All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars. But in general, &quot;The History of Magic and Occult&quot; is a &quot;compact encyclopedia&quot;, you'd like to own.

review/summary: a bibliophiliac wedding of the SURREALIST &amp; the OCCULTIST
review/text: Kurt Seligmann, Surrealist artist par excellence, admitted &amp; unashamed bibliophile, has ravaged his occult library in a miraculous marriage giving birth to this classic historical account of Magic and Occultism; entirely written for the proverbial 'man about the street', and a very cosmic avenue is here tread in an admireable chronological ordering of the various mystical houses. Addressing all the various occult(semantic definition of &quot;hidden &amp; rejected knowledge&quot;) routes via the shortcut of this Art Historian's scholarly mind, as a whole this work is one of the best and most easily approachable &quot;magic histories&quot; for those who have no previous knowledge concerning occultism except an undeniable interest and fascination with the mysterious and the spiritual.Kurt Seligmann is darkly fascinated and explores endlessly the multitude of historic beliefs concerning the study of the nature of evil... such as black magic, necromancy, Elizabethian era conjurers and their Enochian magic,primitive rites, evocations of the Cultus Satanus, Goetia Demonomania, et.al....as an example, early on he discusses Chaldean phliosophies in which: &quot;Evil was born from God's disturbing thoughts&quot;...I have long wondered if the proposed thoughts had to do specifically with humanity?...and this book will surely set the fire or fan the sulphurous flames of those burning to know more about all things occult.The book primarily deals with Western Esoteric Traditions, which, being a westerner, appeals to my insatiable explorative appetite in studying and discovering the divinity of humankind and the accorded propensity &amp; potentials of individual spiritual progress through Magick and the strengthening of divine will ; in comparison with more Eastern idealogies concerned with mystical enlightenment and the abolishing of the ego to attain Nirvana.In summation, Kurt Seligmann, as one of the last efforts of his exemplary artistic journey throughout the early 20th century avant-garde, has given the world a completely unbiased in-depth world history from a magical perspective, a genuine labor of love which will always retain its intimately artistic personality in contrast to the strict scholarly treatise of the newspaper skeptic variety; and although there are better, more developed and intrigueing accounts out there, none are at the moment so readily available and economic, nor so expressive, or conclusively compact as this. Finally, the book has over a hundred and fifty illustrations from alchemical treatise and magical grimoires which compliment his descriptive writing style.It is besides all this, another exclamation point puncuating the Surrealist movement. surrealyours, an occultist.

review/summary: Informative but dry...
review/text: I have the older version of the book, but I understand that the content is generally unchanged.As someone who was desperately seeking some history without the New Age spin, this is a good resource. I'm almost tempted to say excellent resource, for what's there, tho he does focus on Western and Middle Eastern concepts.The main flaw I see with the book is the writing style. It's very 'academic', which I often find is synonomous with dry. I understand why the flashy New Age books sell - they capture the audience who doesn't go for the more scholarly approach... and I have difficult reading this book without my mind wandering.That said - it's not about flash, it's about substance... and it is a very interesting and informative piece of works.

review/text: An incredible collection of stories that will make you gasp and ask for more. I originally read this book in spanish but even when it's translated, it doesn't lose any of it's magic. As you read this book and indulge in the many characters' lives, you realize that they belong to the author's imagination as much as they belong to our wonder and just as much as they belong to our own lives. After every story I had to sit back an process the incredible story I had just read. Rivera-Valdez uses her ease with words to paint not just a portrait of each character, but a landscape. Not only are you able to fully enjoy the secrets in the stories, but you will find yourself wondering what goes on behind your own neighbors' curtains.

review/summary: A Painful Read... Break Out the Coffee
review/text: The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book, it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances, the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field, I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization, I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.

review/summary: It was published. That's an accomplishment.
review/text: First, this text is not the source of the interrelation between Mediterranean Sea cultures. Every book on Hellenistic kingdoms or the Roman Empire presupposes (or should) interrelation of cultures because those political boundaries encompassed a variety of cultures. (A "specialist" should know this.) This text is just what it says: a chronicle of Homer and Moses citings.Second, other authors have expounded on this topic: they have, and they will again. I'm not going to explain in depth here because to do so would be to give away my doctoral thesis. I don't particularly want to see someone else take my sources, present my argument, and have my book published under his/her name.Third, it is extremely difficult to write a doctoral thesis, from my experience. So, while I cannot say that it is the best work on the topic, I think we should have sympathy for doctoral student writers. It is publish or perish, after all. At least it was published. I can only hope for so much for myself.Whether or not you the reader purchase this book is a matter of your own choice. Having to go back to the library for it too often is an indication that one is using it as a reference and not looking to the original sources. That is ill-advised. (Of course, libraries are the friends of "specialists.") But if you have money, and it would make you happy just to peruse every now and then... then by all means give your financial support to Amazon and the author.

review/summary: Profound then. Truly horrible now.
review/text: The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star.

review/summary: Richardson's book a brilliant look at a mysterious person
review/text: This book combines two of the most sought-after items in a biography. First, in Williams, you have an intriguing, mysterious figure who not many people have much information on. Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation.

review/summary: Excellent book for handling feelings
review/text: This is my favorite parenting (and lifeskills) book for learning how to identify, process, and master one's feelings. It is so practical and really applies to any age of child/adult and parenting style. The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says "You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings "You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book! You as the parent will also come away with new and better coping skills for yourself.

review/summary: Excellent perspective on communal living and human nature
review/text: Ironically, I grew up in a small town close to The Farm, but never knew much about it. A friend asked me about it, and when forced to confront my ignorance on the subject I purchased the book to correct that shortcoming. Little did I know how much I was about to be entertained!Voices from The Farm is written--as a book on the communal living experience should be--by a number of the folks who participated. It is a collection of stories that together summarize the experience of the members, and the life-cycle of the community.The Farm and its various off-shoots accomplished some great humanitarian feats in the face of the suspicion and prejudice of its neighbors. Winning over those neighbors provides some of the most entertaining tales in the book. However, the biggest obstacles seem--as with human society in general--to be rooted in the human nature of the members of The Farm community.This book is a great, entertaining collection of stories that together tell the tale of a marvelous exercise in social science and community economics. Excellent work by the editors in preserving, selecting, and arranging the individual contributions to tell the story of The Farm.

review/summary: Intense memoir told in brief segments by former members of The Farm
review/text: This book gave me a glimpse at life on The Farm, as described by people who'd actually lived there. While no book can EVER be a substitute for the daily reality of living on the land, trying to build a community, take care of children, raise food and get through cold winters, reading this book was still a very powerful experience. It made me think about my spiritual values and what it must have been like for those who were trying to live with a commitment to living gently on the earth, not hurting wild creatures, not using leather.I appreciated the honesty as well - as varous people would talk of giving into corruption and sneaking Dr. Pepper soda on a trip to town and other acts that went against general group values. Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood. Others were in a state of transition.Ultimately, the Farm broke up but this book is a powerfl reminder of all that was good about it and of the yearning for finding new ways of building stronger community lives. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I have a feeling many members of The Farm continue to live with similar values as they had back then, when they were simply thought of as crazy "hippies".

review/summary: awesome book about group dynamics of any kind
review/text: This book is a collection of oral histories and some original documents from the early days of the famous Farm commune in Tennessee. The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the "mission creep" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world.

review/summary: A Good Look at the Culture of Assyrians and Israelites
review/text: I was introduced to this book when I was a teenager. I loved it then, and was pleasantly surprised to see it still available. Reading it again to my own children, it was better than I remembered, and loved by all of them, from ages 6 to 14. Although at times the heroine is presented as almost too good to be true, the plot of the book is exciting, and left my children asking me to read one more chapter. The setting of the book provides a great amount of historical detail, leaving the reader with an excellent understanding of the Israelites' constant fear of raiding and invasion by the Assyrians, and a good grasp of daily life in Assyria. The book takes a few unexpected twists and turns, and has enough unanswered questions throughout to keep readers of all ages interested. All in all, a very good choice to help understand this time period.

review/summary: The Battleship Bismarck reviewed
review/text: This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's "Pursuit," published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, "Seekriegsleitung" gets translated as "sea-war-leadership," which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term "naval operations," which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research.

review/summary: Made me take a new look at my life -- and change it.
review/text: This little book is one of the most important works I have read in my 50+ years. With simple, yet incredibly powerful ideas, it challenged me to get &quot;out of my philosophical box&quot; and think again about life, God, and how it all works together. Recalling the simple statement Jesus made, that we &quot;must become like little children...&quot;, I played along with the exercises outlined in the book and found an earth-shaking change taking place in my life. Read this without judgment or prejudice -- and see for yourself!

review/summary: CLEAR AND INSPIRING EXPLANATION OF SPIRITUAL TREATMENT
review/text: Dr Baker explains clearly and engagingly how one can improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called treatment. The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alia, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy, Catherine ponder and Florence Scovel-Shinn, this book should be read repeatedly to provide the maximum benefit.

review/text: Dr. Barker opened the First Church of Religious Science in New York City in 1946, was President of the International New Thought Alliance and a well-known minister, author and teacher throughout the New Thought movement. This classic book is often used in Religious Science classes. Dr. Barker explains how to change the subconscious pattern through spiritual treatment. Some of his statements: There are unfortunately a great many people with attractive surface attitudes but with the same old rubbish underneath (9), If you fail to direct your subconscious mind, it produces under a law of averages, and you are a nice, ineffective sweet person (84), I call treatment mind surgery. It is the way in which you go into the subconscious, destroy old patterns and instill new ones (90).

review/summary: Good help for the willing
review/text: Raymond Charles Barker believes in metaphysics, but you need not share his views on such a weighty topic to derive benefit from this book. Treat Yourself to Life is a manual for productive living -- a self-help book you might say -- and Barker provides a straight-forward approach for getting what you want in terms of love, wealth, health and self-expression.Skeptics may cringe at the author's faith in the individual to create his own destiny through the book's teaching, but Barker responds by urging the reader to assess the merits of the teaching based on real results for the individual.The books divides into chapters on Happiness, Wealth, Love, This Day, Success, Freedom and Life, and offers a method to improve one's experience with regard to each. Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view. Yet the teaching seems more positive and offers a greater faith in human nature. Surely, the reader will have to decide for himself.

review/summary: Harnessing thought-power
review/text: Dr Baker was one of those great 20th century metaphysicians like Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes &Thomas Troward, who understood the working of the mind long before psychotherapy became popular. This approach is called "the religion of healthy mindedness" by William James in his classicThe Varieties of Religious Experience.Barker explains clearly and engagingly how to improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called `treatment.' The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience.

review/text: Considered a classic in the field, TREAT YOURSELF TO LIFE continues to be regarded as one of the best of many guides available to deal with life's challenges. Dr. Barker emphasizes that most psychological techniques lack a spiritual premise with which to bring health, prosperity, and well-balanced personal relationships into action. By changing the subconscious patterns that derail even the best of intentions, you can reprogram yourself for success through Dr. Barker's spiritual mind treatment approach. In getting this book, you are doing something of value for yourself.

review/summary: Highly recommended
review/text: Security specialist Micah Lassiter finds himself in an ethical quandary when wealthy businessman Alan Street hires him to protect his daughter, and Micah quickly finds his heart becoming involved. Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won't welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn't expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won't be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas. Her secondary characters likewise sparkle, from the Lassiter family to the meddlesome sisters that live in the same apartment building as Alan and Prudence. Unexpectedly delightful, BY HONOR BOUND comes highly recommended.

review/summary: Map your Imagination
review/text: It's pretty cool looking at one of these maps that started out as satellite photos and then were filled in with cartographic caricatures (with prime features exaggerated out of scale). You are musing "wow, I didn't know that was out there," and pretty soon you're in the car heading out to see something that no one you know ever heard of. I found something on this map out in the vastness of Kansas called the Chalk Hills, looked it up, it's all on private land but apparently the owners don't mind, there are no fences visible and no other tourists, and there are these natural wonders for you to grok at.http://www.kansasphototour.com/chalk.htmhttp://www.kansasphototour.com/castle.htmhttp://www.ourks.com/chalkpyramids.htmlI have one of these in my own backyard, the Sutter Butteshttp://www.middlemountain.org/picture.htmin the upper part of the Central Valley of California.It is normally invisible in Sacramento because of either smog or agricultural dust. I had never seen it, one day it rained and I saw this magic mountain rising out of the plain. I went to bed, had a dream about it, got up out of my sleep and had to drive there. (Unfortunately, the locals glare at you because of all the bad tourists, and this one is fenced, with some places with weird manhole covers and red-&-white striped antennas sticking up out of the ground.)

review/summary: Smartly done
review/text: Due to the time-lag up to the present (5-9 years after the original publication) it needs to be pointed out that some of the essays may have lost shreds from their novelty; while others, like Al Hidell's charting out the EuroAtlantic grand chessplayers' ulterior geostrategical motives (among them g.o.d.= guns, oil/pipelines, drugs) leading up to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia and to the birth of their latest stepchild, say, in the form of Kosovo, are timelier than ever. Just as Israeli connections (far from being the whole picture) to the 9-11 inside job (& the rest), in another offering from the same author/co-editor, cannot be repeated often enough either.Aside from the articles already referred to in the above editorial review, further titles are as follows:Joan d'Arc: Giordano Bruno: 16th-century ufologist?; The Aviary and the Eschaton: an interview with 'Chicken Little'; Marcel Vogel and the secret of the fifth force; w. Frank Berube: Declaring war on the human spirit: the media spectacle vs. the collective psyche. (Sidebar: Worthwhile to note at this juncture that the historical personage Jeanne d'Arc, whose name the contributing author/co-editor borrowed as her nom de guerre, may not have been burnt alive but lived to the age of 57 as Margarita d'Champdiver, daughter of king Charles VI and his mistress Odetta d'Champdiver. See in David McGowan's "Programmed to Kill. The Politics of Serial Murder" (2004, p. 344 fn. 50) citing a Pravda report dated 01/27/2004.)Frank Berube: The Third Reich of Dreams: Charlotte Beradt's "Diaries of the Night".

review/text: I bought this to help understand care issues specific to the Birman breed, and it really helped. The section on exhibition was interesting, but not really relevant to my needs. It was great to have sections on feeding, grooming, temperament, and health that were tailored specifically to the Birman, since this breed of cat is very unique. It goes into detail on health issues of the Birman such as the breed's propensity for kidney disease and the importance of annual blood work. The book also talks about the gentle nature of this cat and how it needs the companionship of humans much more than other breeds and how easily a Birman can get its feelings hurt and even pout. Grooming tips are given on how to take care of the thick yet fine coat of the Birman. I've found it to be the best book on cat care out there for the Birman and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: My new favorite book from the Avon True Romance series.
review/text: Tess was washed ashore on the Isle of May during a terrible storm eleven years ago, presumed to be the only survivor of a shipwreck. Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting. If you are a fan of the Avon True Romance series, or like historical romances for teens, this book is a must-read.

review/summary: An awesome novel from May McGoldrick
review/text: After enjoying a previous Avon True Romance, Gwyneth and the Thief, I decided to read more from the series. I thought Gwyneth was great, but this is even better yet. Tess is a seventeen-year-old who lives on the Isle of May. She was taken under the care of a couple who oversaw the island, but they have died, and she is completely alone. One day, she finds that a young man is washed ashore, and drags him from the water. She does not want to be near him, as she was warned to stay away from all men, so she hides on the island. Colin Macpherson, a highlander, searches for the young lady who rescued him. Tess is stubborn, but eventually they get to know one another. Tess does not know much about her past, with the exception of nightmares which give small recollections. Colin realizes that Tess is part of the Lindsay clan, and when a ship comes to rescue him from the island, Tess goes with him, in order to find the life she was taken away from eleven years ago. Will she be able to have peace, and be with Colin, the person she has grown to love? Read this very interesting novel to find out. I really enjoyed reading this. Many congratulations to May McGoldrick on writing such a great novel!

review/summary: a great book for Historical romance lovers
review/text: This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels.

review/summary: A great romance
review/text: Tess Lindsey has lived on the remote island of Isle of May and has been raised by the only two other people who lived on the island, all the time uncertain of who she is and her true identity. After the death of her caretakers, she is left on the island all by herself and must do battle alone. That is until one day she rescues a stranger---a stranger who also holds her questions of her past in his very hands. Colin MacPherson has the knack for adventure and a beautiful girl at every single place he visits, that is until he meets Tess...a strong-willed girl that intrigues him at every turn. As the two form a bonding trust Colin begins to piece together the clues of Tess's mysterious past...and a future that most likely will not include him. This definitely has to be one of the best Avon True Romances so far, after Anna and the Duke. I didn't expect it to be this good so it really took me by surprise. Every teenage girl who loves romance should read this book!

review/text: The plot and outline was good, just the writing needed a bit of work. Things were repeated over and over through out the story and became redundant. Talk of children playing with dogs and such. Also there wasn't a good transition in Tess's attitude. She is weepy and scared, but when she gets there she is couragous, makes a speech and confronts a steward? This was okay, but other Avon True Romance books are better. Nicola and the Viscount, and Anna and the Duke being my favorites.

review/summary: good romance for teens
review/text: Tess is alone. For eleven years, an elderly couple raised her after finding her at six, alone and frightened, amongst the rocks on the shoreline of the island they keep. Now, though, Tess' guardians have died, leaving Tess to tend to the island and, as per their orders, hide whenever someone new comes there. When she finds a handsome young Highlander washed up on the shores of her island, she knows she must help him or he will die.As Tess and the handsome Highlander, Colin, spend time together waiting for a ship to come take him home, they form a friendship and discover that Tess is not so alone in the world as she thinks.This was a cute story, and definitely better than the last Avon True Romance (for teens) I picked up. It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute. I would have loved to have seen how Tess and Colin's relationship matures as they do, but that is beyond the scope of this book and the age range it is intended for. I will probably be searching out McGoldrick's adult romance novels, though, given the promise this one held.

review/text: Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one.

I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.

review/text: This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as "teacher" but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first, they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book, which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher, though. All in all, it's a great set and, if mastered, can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator, who speaks English to announce the lessons, is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead!

review/summary: Much more sensible than most books critical of the field.
review/text: This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: "Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)." Or "Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)." Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover.

review/summary: Fascinating and Terrifying
review/text: Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can't figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don't agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care.

review/summary: Informative, but left me wanting more
review/text: I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn't say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did't give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don't suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine.

review/summary: Somatic medicine as an alternative to psychiatry?
review/text: Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM "a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis."The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only "treatment" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on "bad parenting." No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually "incompetent, lazy, or bad." He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the "adult orphanage."Those of you who are interested in "alternative psychiatry" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf

review/summary: This book should be required reading by psychiatrists
review/text: This book should be required reading by all psychiatrists. There is still so much to learn from this maverick psychiatrist. Dr.Sydney Walker 111 was an unforgettable and unique and towering giant,we will not find another Dr.Sydney Walker again!! The closest thing to another Dr.Walker in Canada might be the ill-fated Dr.Ed Pakes,a brilliant pioneer bereavement psychiatrist. There is also Dr.Robin Brooks-Hill. Then there is an aloof South African &quot;Shrink&quot;,and his son,who wrote some book called &quot;Freud&quot;. (Obviously that isn't really the correct title,but it is a free country) Besides,why see Dr.Aloof Shrink when you can watch Meryl Streep films on Video. Bouchard is no longer a power,Richler is dead,Where is Trudeau or Lon Chaney Jr when we need him?

review/summary: King James Scores!
review/text: Ryan Jones is a great basketball writer. In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, "I don't want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was." Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though "there wasn't much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better." Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike. I give this book an eight out of ten and recommend it highly.

review/summary: KING JAMES is awsome
review/text: My story is about LeBron James and how he grew up. When he was a freshman in high school he won tournament MVP for the state, which is amazing.The beginning starts at his childhood and continues so on. My favorite part in the book is when he's a freshman and he played football. Their team made it to state. They lost in the finals, but he got All State. That means hes one of the best in the state. Later that year he made the basketball team. They made it to the state finals. They won and LeBron got MVP. That happened for the next three years.Ryan Jones is a senior editor at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine. He lives in New York. I would recommend this book to sports fans that like LeBron James. The age and gender I would recommend this book to is ages 13-35 and boys.

review/text: This was a very cool book. It had a ton of great inside stuff I didn't know about The Man. The sneaker stuff was really interesting. Clearly LeBron was under enormous pressure to perform and to do the right thing, and even with the scounts and everything esle going on he gave 100% to his high school team, The Irish. Jones does a great job taking us inside the making of a star.

review/text: This was a AWESOME book. It really looks into the real life of LEBRON JAMES and shows you his trip into stardom. This book is great if you like watching basketball careers grow because is probably the most popular young basketball players in the world today and this book did a really good job of showing how LEBRON is always improving his game. I have read a ton of sports autiobiographies and this one was probably the most inspiring because it took an indept look at the personal and also basketball part of LEBRON JAMES life.

review/text: King James by Ryan Jones is a biography of Lebron's James' life prior to going into the NBA. It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.

review/summary: The Truth on King James!
review/text: I first heard about Lebron when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and followed him ever since. I thought I read a lot about him, but reading this book told me so much that I had never known about Lebron as a player, a person, and all the hype and attention he got from the media, the shoe companies and everyone else. The fact that he dealt with so many distractions and people hating on him and still succeeded was really inspirational. This book has tons of info and quotes from Lebron, and it shows that he seems like a cool guy, too. I would definitely recommend this book if you're a fan of Lebron or just a fan of basketball and sports in general.

review/summary: Yo Homie this is my sweet review
review/text: LeBron James is a basketball hero. He has a big story on how he got to the NBA. LeBron was very poor growing up; his father left him and his mother when he was young. LeBron had to live with friends so his mom could work to keep a roof over their heads. A cool thing I thought LeBron did is when he was signing autographs an adult pushed over a kid just to get LeBrons signature but LeBron said "Let me sign the kids first". I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish. LeaBron is a great role model to young kids because he never gave up and told himself that he could do it. LeBron now is in the NBA and won the Rookie of the Year award.Written by Gerald P. Willamspoon

review/summary: This is an excellent book
review/text: While this book captures the hip sensibilities of SLAM, it's objective is not to be cool. The objective was clearly to tell LeBron James story, and the author does so fluidly and intelligently. The only issue I had when it came out was if LeBron warranted an entire book. Given that he's spent the first three quarters of his rookie season proving he may have even be underrated, consider the book warranted. So, basketball fans, if you want to know the real LeBron James story before it gets changed or distorted by the corporations that are soon to be even more involved in his life, check out this book and you'll get all the background you need to be able to intelligently discuss the first superstar of the new millenium.

review/text: This was quite an enjoyable read. I was fascinated by the rise and rise of this basketball prodigy due to all the hype surrounding him. There is no doubt that Lebron James is one hell of a talent after seeing many of his highlight plays on T.V, and on the net. This book details his performances in school for ST Vincent-ST Mary and other events, the frenzied interest from fans and media wanting to see him perform, sport commentators and coaches raving about him being the best thing in the sport of basketball, hummergate, speculation about his future career plans, and the fight for his feet between Adidas and Nike in which the latter won because the former could not offer huge amounts of money in the bidding war with its major rival. Great stuff.

review/text: I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans.

review/text: I have somewhere over a dozen titles on timber frame construction. This is the one I keep referring back to when it comes to my own construction plans. It is not written as a commercial for the next timber frame workshop as many of these books are. It shows several different building and roof styles rather than a single one. Good detail on joints and joinery as well as planning figures are included. All in all this book is excellent reference material for someone actually wishing to build.

review/text: This book has been completely instrumental in guiding my husband in his timberframing pursuits. He has read it so much the cover and binding have fallen off and broken! But he holds on to it because it's the BEST reference for a DIYer to look to when starting your structure.

review/summary: Ok reference book
review/text: Dated (1980's) so don't expect a lot of current technology for this ancient craft. A pretty good read and part of my collection. This book is also co-authored by Sobon. Of the three (Build a Classic Timber-Framed House, Timber Frame Construction: All About Post-and-Beam Building and this one), you need this one the least. Interesting history but not so much on the construction aspect.

review/summary: My favorite Timber Framing Book
review/text: Timber framing is my hobby, and I own several books on the subject, but this has always been my favorite. The how-to section is very thorough, and includes information on tools and techniques. The author's enthusiasm for the subject is what really makes the difference, though. The sections on history and woodworking are especially good. If a friend wanted to try timber framing, and asked me which book to buy first, I would pick this one without hesitation.

review/summary: Great Book...early work on Timber Framing
review/text: This book is one of the classics on Timber Framing for those who want to get into this type of construction or build their own house. It is a very easy read. Though sometimes the author tends towards to much philosophy about life, construction and wood working.This book has very useful sections on joinery, design, raising, engineering, load physics, etc. Very easy to understand even if, like me, you are not a professional carpenter, contractor or mechanical engineer. I know nothing of contracting or building and understood the whole book.The book does not mention anything about Scribe Rule and Square Rule techniques and the differences between the two. These old techniques may not have been widely known when this book was written, although they were well known by early timber frame carpenters, before Timber Framing was replaced with cheaper, but faster Balloon Framing.A book that does go into Square Rule in a more structured way and is equally easy to read is Buid a Classic Timber-Framed House, by Jack Sobon.

review/summary: Nearly three decades old and more relevant than ever
review/text: This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was "green" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term "stick built" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. "Wood never lies to you." "You don't just hack away obliviously." As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:"To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries."Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a "passivhaus" or "passive house", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a "green" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes.

The only reason I did not give this family biography a 5 star rating is because some of the historical data in the living members of the Jaquith family is not correct.

review/text: The book offers a good overview of the subject of woodburning. The types of tools needed are discussed; however, it was short on explanation here. The author should have spent more time examining the different types of tools and the qualities of each type. The book discusses the best types of wood for pyrographic efforts and this was useful. The book has a wide variety of designs from birds to seashore items. All are well drawn. The disigns are complex, and they are printed in the book very lightly. The problem in reproducing them comes from the lightness of the picture and the complex design. They do not reproduce as well as disigns I have found in other books.Overall I found the book informative and the designs excellent.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing.

review/summary: Tales of the world I never knew and never will
review/text: Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, "The Seance" and "The Letter Writer" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form.

review/text: Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!

review/text: THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of "Yanda" is a provincial prostitute, while "Zeitl and Rickel" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a "take a book, leave a book" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable.

review/summary: Not sure about the title
review/text: This not a &quot;how to&quot; guide to &quot;swinging&quot; (or whatever people call it) but in fact much more a book that addresses the question of being together and growing with a partner while retaining individuality and seperatedness within a relationship of honesty, trust and openess. I felt a lot less cynical and much more positive about the institution of marriage as a result of reading this book.I thought it was excellent and I feel it's a book that would probably appeal to many more people if the title was different. But then again it was because of the title that I found it. Highly recommended for any relationship whether or not marriage is a part of it.

review/summary: A great informative must read. Not just for open marriage.
review/text: I feel that this book can apply to every romantic pairing. This is not just a book for those contemplating an open marriage. This is a book that can give you great ideas regarding space in a relationship. It expands on the idea that just because you are part of a couple does not mean you have to give up yourself. It promotes the idea of still mainting and developing new ideas and hobbies about yourself. It really has so very little to do with sex and more to do with keeping your own life exciting and not expecting the marriage to solve all your fulfilment needs.

review/summary: An Excellent Book about Open Marriage - NOT Swinging!
review/text: The title of this book has become misleading only because the meaning of the words "Open Marriage" has changed over the decades.This book is an excellent guide for people interested in all the aspects of attaining and living in an open marriage, which is an overall way of life, not just sexual freedom. Everything from sex to doing the dishes is covered in this book. Some of the language may sound dated since it's original printing, but then again, so does Shakespeare.This the best book I have ever found to learn about ALL aspects of your marital relationships (not just the sexual ones) and discover the ways in which people try to control and eventually destroy each other as individuals within a marriage.If you want a book on "swinging" (a/k/a recreational, non-monogomous sex) then this is NOT the book you are looking for. But then again, Open Marriage is leaps and bounds beyond just swinging. This book guides you through making this a way of life in a wonderful way, changing the traditional marriage views in ALL aspects, including non-monogomous sex, but not JUST sex.How do I know this? I've been living this way for 15 years and still going happy and strong. My first "traditional" marriage lasted 3 years.

review/summary: title refers to open communication and self examination, not swinging
review/text: Please don't be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn't worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an "open" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum "An unexamined life is not worth living" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:"The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride."One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in "bitter disappointment" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn't going well, and someone angrily threatened that "we all had better start having fun right now!" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental "maps" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine.

review/summary: Outdated & overripe
review/text: This book reached its "sell before" date about 25 years ago. Better books have been written, but haven't been hyped so thoroughly, so it keeps getting reprinted.The "open marriage" concept has -- REPEAT AFTER ME -- absolutely nothing to do with sexual nonmonogamy. Rather, the authors examine the problem of what another author has called "the couple front," where couples feel they must act as if they're surgically joined, & end up feeling confined & eventually hating each other.If you are NOT interested in nonmonogamy, then read ANY book by Harville Hendrix & you'll find thoughts that are much more practical.If you ARE interested in nonmonogamy (group marriage, polyamory, etc.), then start with Intimate Friendships (Ramey), Polyamory (Ravenscroft -- whoops, that's me), Polyamory (Anapol), Honest Sex (Roy & Roy), or Group Marriage (Constantine & Constantine)... or even The New Faithful (Nearing), or Three in Love (Foster).I usually see ten copies of this book at any thrift store. That's somehow fitting.

review/text: This book is a classic when it pertains to building and establishing a relationship that works for you and your partner. It is written with a much different perspective and definition of an open marriage than today's view of Open Marriage.I highly urge anyone in a relationship to read this book together with their partner as a way to stimulate and nurture individual and collective growth.Please keep in mind the time period this book was written in, as some of the examples used to illustrate points will not speak to the current dynamics between the sexes.Overall, it's a thoughtful and transforming read.

review/summary: Actually, some decent advice.
review/text: The criticisms of this book are mostly about its non-monogamous aspect: the O'Neills (allegedly) broke up, therefore their relationship style is null and void. By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is "together until death" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, "open marriage" back then didn't mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don't have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don't have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn't share. You don't have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don't make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about "the grass is always greener", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the "love and sex without jealousy" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren't very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a "one and only way" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the "emotional infidelity" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn't.

review/summary: Hard to get thru, but worth it in the end
review/text: The O'Neills' exciting, original approach to married life shows you and your mate how the stifling, limited arrangement you've always thought marriage had to be can be opened up into an honest, undemanding, joyful relationship. they'll introduce you to the OPEN MARRIAGE concepts-trust, liking, role flexibility, individual freedom and growth, and love and sex without jealousy-that can do wonders for your marriage. OPEN MARRIAGE must be read before you get married-or before your marriage gets a day older!~*~This book needs to modernized. I see there is a 1984 version, but I don't know how that fits in today's age. It is a dry read, but I pushed thru and did get a few ideas to allow my own marriage to grow and flourish.

review/summary: A step in the right direction!
review/text: This is ground breaking work. It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree. If you dare to read this book, be prepared to be radically changed forever!

review/summary: Never gets going
review/text: This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written.

review/summary: Fissure a mile-wide in this thin, confusing novel.
review/text: Early on in this story reader is informed that main character has a split personality. 3 girls are murdered and buried in back yard of Mary Barton, protagonist. Mary B. is sweet and loves her garden. Her other half is wicked to the max. The novel starts with her cussing like a sailor, wholly unlike sweet Mary B. The incredibly stupid atty. doesn't infer anything about the seeming two Mary's. Mary B. charged with murder that she obviously committed. Most of book contains court scenes that are well-written but are merely banal and static, the story stops. After conviction inevitable knife attack on atty by bad Mary, who we now learn is a twin of good Mary; at least that's the way the book reads. Within the reality of the book this is impossible and nonsense. But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality. But, no, the book is saying that there are two Maries...not one with a good and bad side. If you want to read a lot of fairly interesting courtroom questioning by prosecutor and def. atty, most of the book is irrelevantly devoted to this, so read it and enjoy an O.J. moment. Perhaps the worst mystery/suspense novel I have ever read. This is my fourth and last McBain novel. HIs stories read at supersonic speed and purposefully divert the reader from thinking about the plot, characters, conflict,etc. Recommended solely for no-depth crowd of mystery readers (90% of readers are in this category; hence, the popularity ofjames patterson, Sue Grafton, Kellerman's,and many more; can anyone actually read Elizabeth George's prose and not become constipated and nauseous). Also, irrelevant romance between Mary's defense atty and female prosecutor. Added nothing to story, except perhaps to be a lame red herring that the femme fatale might have something to do with the murders.

Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!

My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy &quot;Trouble on Titan.&quot;

Hydrocarbons are lying about on the surface, in pools larger than the great lakes. Just by dumb luck, the place turns out to be almost exactly how Nourse imagined it. What a piece of work is Man. Especially that one.I read it in 1960, and could see then that it's not really about sports-rockets (although there is a cool one). It's everything a "juvenile" could ever be, with a father-son rapprochement, East-is-East friendships that grow between opposite equals, first love, labor trouble, industrial sabotage, and a rebellion conspiracy. When I first read Heinlein later that year, I thought he suffered by comparison. I was eight at the time.

review/summary: Orca Wisdom as told by Mary Getten
review/text: Whales in the dreams of children, whale spirituality, whale sex and whale governance are all things we'll not likely get from scientific researchers for decades, perhaps a century or two. That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in "Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:"I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: "Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette."Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: "Can't you say anything but hello?"Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as "The Prime Cause," are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson

review/text: This book is one of the most profound and wonderful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading! It's a beautiful true story that tells of two animal communicators, Mary and her good friend Raphaela, and their conversations with Granny. Granny is a 92 (est.) year-old orca who lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, J Pod. During Mary and Raphaela's time conversing with Granny, they question her on many aspects of orca life from finding food to orca spirituality. Granny relays a very important message to the human race in this book. A message that MUST NOT be overlooked! This book should be read and emabraced by all. Granny's words certainly opened my eyes and made me see things in a different light. Open your mind and your heart. Read this book!

review/summary: Communication at its Best!!
review/text: When I first picked up the book, Communicating with Orcas by Mary Getten, I was mildly interested in learning about Orca whales. After reading the first few pages I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished reading it. This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you. Many past cultures had a closeness to nature that has been lost in today's world. This book takes a refreshing step back into what was and is still possible if we are open to believing

But well beyond that, whether or not one accepts the author's ability to communicate with the orcas, what she relates about the wisdom of whales (primarily Granny, the 90+year old leader of J pod) is a wake-up call for humanity.

review/text: I found this book amazing. I'm from Michigan and we "Michiganders" tend to think about lakes not oceans. This book opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about the world. It also made me start to think about the oceans creatures in more than just a "far away" way. If you do believe in animal communiation you will find this book to be a wonderfully different type of perspective. If you think animal communication is a "bunch of nonsense" this book may seem really strange to you, but it also makes you start to think "What if the whales do think, What if other animals think, what would they think of us and our running, running rather than enjoying and loving life" I highly recommend this book to all!!

review/text: I LOVED Mary Getten's book "Communicating with Orcas". I couldn't put it down. Reading it, my sense of life's inter-connectedness was profoundly deepened. After I read this book I looked at all life with new eyes and a new heart.I was touched by Getten's love and respect for the Orcas and her courage to share this information with the world. I mean, where else are you going to learn about, among other things, whale sex from their perspective!!!? Her conversations with Granny made me laugh at times, cry at others. They changed me.I have given this book as a gift to several friends and find myself lending out my copy frequently. Reading this book fosters a new reverence for life. Sharing this book with others is one way I work to bring healing to the earth.

review/summary: Great Piece of Scientific Journalism
review/text: i guess there are still come people out there who feel that telepathic communication with animals is impossible. They must not live with pets! I live with 3 dogs and i KNOW we communicate. One thing that is great about this book is that Mary Getten is a scientist, and brings that objectivity to her studies of the orcas. She enlists another communicator, Raphaela Pope, so that they can confirm each other's information. I found this book to be a very well-rounded piece of scientific journalism, they interviewed their subjects on many different topics to present an in-depth view of life from a whales's perpective. I haven't spent much time with whales but this book was a great introduction, probably the best!!

review/summary: Not Convinced...
review/text: I got this book about 3 years ago, and I was really excited, because I got it for Christmas. Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in "Freeing Keiko" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so.

review/summary: Dishonest
review/text: Most of the authors of this book say, in effect, that they are accused of being anti-American. By right-wing fanatics! But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that "pro-Israel lobbying groups" and others are "policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse." Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers "effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism." That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's "extracurricular" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was "disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism." But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that "any criticism of Israel" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote "violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state." Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs "the American Likud." He says "this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions." And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is "false and brazenly bigoted." It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards.

review/summary: Pretty good, although a few flaws
review/text: This is, all-around, a pretty good lawn book. However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]

review/summary: Good (albeit inconsistent) advice; your lawn will improve.
review/text: After reading through this book twice, highlighting various tips and tidbits, I realized that I couldn't put it all together into one organized plan. So I went through the book a third time, taking notes, and trying to categorize the author's advice. Guess what? It's not possible. This how-to book IS very disorganized, and worse, internally inconsistent. However, I concluded that if I just took a stab at using parts of his advice, formulas, when-to's, etc., that my lawn would probably improve. It did. No question. I like the fact that his methods are easy and inexpensive. I got much better results than I did with my previous 6x/year TrueGreen lawn service for $250. If you're interested in understanding what your lawn wants, this book has the advice if you're willing to sift through the disorganization.

review/summary: The greenest grass imaginable
review/text: I bought this book for my husband. He follows it faithfully, and you can see the results in our yard. We have the most beautiful, lush grass in the neighborhood - which seems to be a miracle, since our yard was an overgrown field just two years ago. Jerry Baker provides simple ways to establish and maintain your lawn. I also appreciate the fact that we do not have to go to a gardening store to find the items recommended in his book.

review/summary: It might be easier to be green than you think!
review/text: I'm sure my fellow gardeners have noticed how a nicely tended strip of grass sets off a garden bed perfectly! Designers say our eyes need a place to rest before we can see all the beauty in front of us. Although most people make their New Years resolutions in December or January, I promise myself every July I am going to do something about my grass.....something other than dig it all up. We've all seen Jerry Baker on television spraying ammonia and dish soap all over his yard...I find it very intriguing. Jerry's book on lawn care has a ton of info to offer..and true enough it is a little hard to follow sometimes, but most people will not do everything anyway. For my poor lawn anything is an improvement, so if you are task-oriented, schedule based and really really care about your lawn this book should be very helpful. There are a lot of chemicals included in the regimen so beware if you like me avoid them. But there is a lot here that will be used on my own little patch of soon to be healthier grass. If you want more details, reviews of other gardening books or simple little garden musings.

review/summary: Has many helpful tips if not a systematic guide
review/text: This book is not a detailed lawn program for lawn care. It is more or less a collection of articles and tips on lawn care. I certainly found many useful tips and helpful advice as I read through the book. However, in reading it front to back you will find that Mr. Baker differs in some small details from one presentation to the next, but his overall conception of what goes into a good lawn remains quite consistent throughout.Mr. Baker offers several of his famous tonics that I look forward to trying. Some of the advice seems a tad dated - he talks about buying things from Brookstone that aren't offered on their website anymore and he doesn't mention his own website www.jerrybaker.com that does offer many of them and more.The book discusses different types of grass and weeds, but doesn't offer much in the way of pictures. There are books that do and I find the pictures of the weeds very helpful in identifying them. But this book does offer state-by-state help on certain things and resources you can tap to get more information - very helpful.This book is certainly worthy the price I paid for it and I like the tips I picked up. It isn't perfect, but deserves a place on your shelf.

review/summary: Good tips, but poorly organized
review/text: The book gives good tips on lawn care, but must be one of the most disorganized writings I have ever seen. Information is provided in bits and pieces here and there, and is someitmes inconsistent. For example, the beer &amp; amonia tip is given on at least three occaisions, each time with different mixture ratios and &quot;optimal&quot; application dates. Chapter 11 makes a half-baked effort do give a summary of the most important points in one place, only to be followed by a Q&amp;A chapter the muddles the situation. If you have the patience and desire to sort out the mess I think that the book is well worth the price.

review/summary: not just for theologists
review/text: What a wonderful book! As an interested layperson with no background in philosophy or ethics, I've been trying to answer the question "What, exactly, does it mean to live a moral (Christian) life?". While this clear and highly readable book isn't meant to give superficially pat answers of the Chicken-Soup-for-the-Soul genre, its thorough explaination and assessment of the dramatic changes of thought of one of the most influential Christian theologians of our time allowed me to understand why Roman Cathohlics currently believe what they (we) beieve and how they got there. This book, while not taking sides, gave me the background to think more productively and clearly about my question.

review/summary: A testament to horrors
review/text: This over-sized 255 page volume is based a November 1991 through October 1999 U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibit on the experiences of Kovno Ghetto residents during World War II, as they secretly photographed and artistically recorded them.In addition, the volume contains many images of Ghetto work documents and other Nazi-issued papers, and even the luggage tags of Jews transported from Germany and Austria for murder at "Fort IX," a fortification built near Kovno specifically to murder Jews, which executions began on June 24, 25, and 27, 1941, following the Nazi invasion of Lithuania.On October 28, 1941, the Germans separated 30,000 Jews from the square in Kovno, those to the left survived at least temporarily, and those to the right, were immediately marked for brutalization and ultimate death. for the time being, 20,000 remained. Everyone left lost a family member, and mourning set upon the community.Needless to say, their lot was not easy, and most ultimately succumbed.This is a valuable testament to horrors suffered in the Holocaust by one community, horrors that were repeated in every other ghetto across Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and so on.Heartbreaking.--Alyssa A. Lappen

review/summary: A museum exhibit inside a book
review/text: This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust.

review/summary: Good introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine
review/text: As a physician who is studying and doing acupuncture, I find this a good basic introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is heavily illustrated, which helps the reader to understand some very difficult concepts, which are alien to the Western mind, especially for medical personnel. I can highly recommend it for someone who is interested in becoming familiar with Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine.

I practice acupuncture and have found much of the information useful for preparing lectures, not only for the general public, but for other physicians as well. It's a versatile book good not only for it's comprehensive content, but also as a coffee table book as the illustrations are great. Would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the vast offerings of Chinese Medicine.

review/summary: The BEST introduction to Chinese Medicine on the market.
review/text: My partner is a Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic "anatomy", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can't think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

review/summary: A profound if somewhat exaggerated analysis of 'global secularization'
review/text: How the world has changed since Harvey Cox argued that there is an inevitable and inexorable process of global secularization which is leading to a total separation of the political and religious. Cox's argument was that urbanization and secularization go together, and that they empty the world of mythic and traditional religious power.Today forty years after the publication of his book the world is in the midst of a global struggle in which the forces of Western democratic society are pitted against a radical Islamic revivalist fundamentalism. Moreover within the realms of other religions including Christianity there has been a kind of 'return to religion' which was certainly not dreamnt of in Cox analysis. He did not have a clue in regard to the Evangelical revival in the United States, and the prominent place it would come to play, ( Perhaps unprecedented place) in American politics.This does not make Cox's analysis wrong for his time. Nor was he mistaken in seeing the important trend to secularization. He only made the mistake most of us make of seeing the past and future of what seemed to him the predominant and irreversible trend of his time.But History and the development of Mankind have a way of surprising us all.As a footnote I would say that the one area of the world in which Cox analysis does seem to be largely correct today is Europe. 'Post-Christian Europe' however does not seem the apogee of human enlightentment , the wave of the future. Rather it seems more a declining island already invaded by those kind of 'religious forces it expelled as Christian and is receiving as Muslim'.Irony of ironies, that the very heart of the 'secular city' today seems as if it will in a matter of generations take a great fall into backwardness. But again this is an aside, and I would instead make the more general caveat, that no one should fall so readily into the underlying assumption of Cox's analysis i.e. that there is a predominant historical trend for the future which we can clearly discern.Wisdom and humility would suggest that we rely more on our powers of future observation than of extrapolation from the Past.

review/summary: A strange and enigmatic book...
review/text: A friend gave me this book a couple of years ago and I find that I return to it again and again. It is a series of 365 short meditations on being in relationship with God. The meditations can be, at times, astoundingly difficult to understand. But every now and then one pops out that is so perfect I am convinced that this crazy Spanish mystic must have been on to something.If you are trying to deepen your relationship with the Divine, do yourself a favor: Get this book.

review/summary: Challenging but rewarding
review/text: If sometimes the meaning is inaccessible the emotion and spirit is not. Here there is a strong mission-minded and mystical insight into the reflections of one of the great minds of medieval Christianity. Llull, who is known as a missionary, poet, novelist, mystic, philosopher, father and husband, and even perhaps an alchemist, strongly connects tribulation-suffering with the greater experience of God's love. A challenging message.

review/summary: one of the best night world books!!!!
review/text: first of all i thought that this was one of lj smith's best books she has written adn also the funniest. i love all the characters but my fave one in the book is Ash. he's really a hottie and a babe i just love him 4 trying 2 be real. so far ash and thierry are my 2 most fave male characters in the night world series. anyways this book is about 3 sisters who are fugitives from the night world trying to live normal lives with humans but finding out that theyre brother Ash wants them back home. and meets up with mary- lynnette who turns out to be his soulmate but doesnt want it as much as she doesnt want it either. anyways i thought Ash was a much better character in daughters of darkness than in secret vampire i thought he acted like a jerk in the 1st night wortld book. it tells me that he has gotten better and that not all humans are bad to live by. i would love to have a guy like Ash for a bf. he's a total babe. funny 2. well g2g also if anyone is waiting for strange fate 2 come out it wont be coming out til 2004.

review/text: Once started I couldn't put it down, literally. I didn't stop til I'd read it through.Three sisters on the run from the Night Worlds patriachal society, they visit Oregon. Their brother finds out where they are and tries to drag them back, except for a few minor details he has it all figured out. 1. someone else knows where the girls are and if Ash doesn't bring them back, Quinn will bring in the authorities. 2. Ash has found his soulmate Mary-Lynette who also knows their secret identity. 3. someone killed their aunt and they don't know who, is it a vampire hunter or someone who knows the truth.The vampires are in danger and Ash and Mary-Lynette have fallen in love.

review/summary: Disappointing to say the least
review/text: This book is probably, in my opinion, one of (if not THE) worst in the Night World Series. It is Ash's story this time, who's soulmate just happens to be a human. (which Ironically was shadowed upon in the first book, 'Secret Vampire'.) Ash's character was cool, charismatic....and totally wasted in this book. Mary Lynnette was too self riteous, too...I don't know. To me, she didn't come off as the strong female lead she was supposed to. Instead, I found myself annoyed at her several times throughout the book. She was presumptuous, she was always assuming things, and she was rather stereotypic if you ask me. I think someone like Maggy from 'Black Dawn', or even someone like Hanna or Gillian from 'Soulmate' and 'Dark Angel' would have been a better match for Ash, not this smart alec, holier than thou woman named Mary Lynnette.The book itself was lacking as well. We pretty much learn nothing about the nightworld, it doesn't much progress the series except to mention a few characters that appear in future books. All in all, a disappointment. Ash's first appearance in 'Secret Vampire' stole the show, so when this book was released, I was ecstatic. 'Finally', I thought. 'Something that touches on Ash's past and personality. We will finally get to read his story.' Well, as it turned out, he was poorly underwritten. Or perhaps this particular book would have worked better if it had been a little later in the series, if Mary Lynnette wasn't so sharp tongued, if there weren't so many CHARACTERS to concentrate on. This wasn't so much Ash and M.L's story as it was all the sisters. Too many people to concentrate on. The three sisters should have been given their own book for character developement if that was the case. I would suggest this book only to those who wish to further their Night World series collection, or just their L.J Smith collection, in general. As for the enjoyment factor?...Nadda.

review/summary: Excellent Book!!!!!!
review/text: The plot, setting, mood and atmosphere in Daughters of Darkness was very potential. Ms. Smith developed the characters very well. The only improvement for this book should be the style and wording of the text. Even though L.J. Smith describes her characters well, she tends to repeat things more than necessary. It is good to remind the readers what a charater looks and acts like, but it seems that every other page she repeated the same thing or switched the characters in the content like she could not think of anything else to say.

review/summary: The Best of the Night World
review/text: Though the plot is much like that of Pride and Prejudice, this book has a real feeling and flow that the rest of the Night World books can't compare with. There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn't go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period.

review/summary: This book is one of my favorates.
review/text: I have read just about everything L.J. Smith has ever written. It all started when a friend of mine gave me The Strange Power- Vol. 1 of my favorate L.J. trilogy entitled Dark Visions and I loved it! I read everything I could get my hands on by her!! Before I discovered these books I never read anything due to sheer boredom. Now I feel that these books have helped me immensly! Anyway, I really should get on to my comments concerning the book. Daughters Of Darkness is really one of the best Night World books of all. It is sweet, suspenseful, and well written all in one great package. Unfortunetly, though these book literally melt my heart, I am afriad I will never find a man worthy of my all time favorate L.J. Smith badboys such as Ash(Daughters of Darkness), Gabriel(mmm.. oh! um Dark Visions), Nick(Secret Circle), and Quinn(short but sweet... from The Chosen). Oh well!! Anyhow read the books, people!! Then you'll know what I'm talking about!! OK!!???

Mary-Lynnette and Ash are so realistic, besides that he's a vampire. My favorite part is when Mare keeps kicking him in the shins. It's funny, because it also tells us (this is what I interpreted) that it doesn't matter what race you are, it matters whats on the inside. Afterall, like Jade says, &quot;You can't be soulmates with vermin!&quot

review/summary: Second Book in the Night World Series
review/text: Set in Briar Creek, Oregon, "Daughters of Darkness" primarily follows 17-year-old Mary-Lynnette Carter, though the book is supposedly about her new neighbors, three vampire sisters: Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern. The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven't read any of the other books in this series and can't compare this one to the others, I really liked "Daughters of Darkness." It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances.

review/summary: This book had me giggling
review/text: I'm sorry, but I just find the way Mary Lennette treats Ash to be just hillarious. Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don't know, maybe the way I said it isn't that funny, but I thought it was hillarious. Ash is hillarious with his little side comments and he's simply a very interesting character. It took me awhile to get myself to finally buy it, but its definetly a good read.

review/summary: Another awesome book from LJ Smith!
review/text: Daughters of Darkness, the second book in LJ Smith's Night World series, is probably the best book in the series.Mary-Lynette is the intellectual heroine in this book. She's a human obsessed with astromomy who's stumbled across a strange, supernatural secret about the new girls next door. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are beautiful vampire sisters who have escaped from their strict home across the country. Mary Lynette and her brother, Mark, become quick friends with the sisters, but someone doesn't want them to live in harmony.And then there's the slight problem that the girls' brother, Ash (who appeared in the first Night World book, Secret Vampire), who has come to bring his sisters back. Ash is icy cold and ruthless, but Mary Lynette might just be the person to melt his heart.This book is so awesome that you won't want to put it down until you've finished. But I would definitely recommend reading the Night World series in order, since the characters reappear and the events link together, so if you haven't read Secret Vampire yet, do that first. But if you have, definitely read this book!

review/summary: THIS IS MY FAV BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!
review/text: This is the best book out of the Night World series. At first, in the first book, u think Ash is the bad guy, but that opinion totally goes out the window when u read this book.(The same thing w/ Quinn, but that's another book) I have all the Night World books and love them all. I've read them all over and over, but this is my fav. I can totally relate w/ the feeling of longing Mary-Lynette felt at the beginning, and like her, I am looking for someone to share the night w/ (even though i know only a little about astronomy) Ash is definantly a character. He's strong-willed, and has a smart mouth, but is vulnerable like a hurt child underneath it all. There needs to be another book that continues the story of Ash, Mary-Lynette, Mark and the sisters. Ash had small parts in Dark Angel (when he got Gillian out of that club Angel lured her in) and in Soulmates (when he was in Circle Daybreak when he met Hannah and told her about his soulmate.) If you haven't read this one yet, it is a must read. I beleive in soulmates and it makes me wish for mine even more If only the Night World really existed . . . but oh well. I hope you bring in Mary-Lynette and Ash again, I would really like to know the outcome.

review/summary: Quick and Fun
review/text: As an adult reader I gave this a 3 star because some things were not very logical. The story was well written and as a teen I think I would have given it a 4 maybe even a 5. I would not mind letting my children read this book as the love relationships are based on emotions rather than physical appearance and pleasure. The relationship between the characters are healthy, for example they do not have the male stalking the female or the female saying she is going to die without the male. Yes that is a comparison to the Twilight series, but this series was written long before Twilight was thought of.The parts I did not find logical is the fact the vampire girls were not going to use any of the powers in the new town they moved too. Why not? I get that they did not want to kill their food (people) but why not talk to each other telepathically. What is the point of not doing that? No one would have known they were doing that. Vampires are stronger than people and one girl had a hard time doing a task a human could do without a problem. Another thing that bothered me about this book is Poppy and James are not in this book. There was a thought of them for a second but I would have liked something to let me know how they were doing. Is Poppy still an illegal vampire? Did her dad except them and her living dead situation? I mean so many unanswered questions.

review/summary: Night World 2: Daughters of Darkness
review/text: Night World #2: Daughters of Darkness, by L. J. SmithFor me, "Daughters of Darkness" is the one sour note in Smith's Night World series. It was the one book in the nine book series that I had to force myself to finish (I am obsessive about finishing everything I read).The concept is interesting, but I feel it could have used better execution. As with all Night World books, the protagonist is female. Mary-Lynette is a human and unaware of the secret world of vampires, werewolves, and other spooky things that exist around her. She thinks she lives in the quietest, most boring town in the world, but that's all about to change when a series of startling events happens.When the next door neighbor goes missing just as her three nieces arrive in town, and Mary-Lynette sees them burying something in the backyard, she's immediately suspicious. Unable to leave the mystery alone, she heads next door and meets the new arrivals, who further her apprehension about the disappearance of her neighbor. The girls remind her of predators, which is unsurprising as the girls are lamia, or born vampires.The mystery of who killed the neighbor takes up a good chunk of the book, and in my opinion, is very over used. It just drags on too long, and every time there was a new twist in the whodunit, I kept thinking, "Okay, that's the end of it now...no, wait...there's more. Sigh."Ash Redfern also makes an appearance in this book (some readers may remember him from "Night World #1: Secret Vampire," where he waylaid Poppy), and is a starring character along with his sisters. Initially he's on the hunt for the three sisters, who ran away from a vampire enclave. Ash is characterized as the ultimate vampire - humans are vermin and nothing more, to him. Mary-Lynette takes an immediate dislike to him when meeting him for the first time. And here's where the potentially interesting concept comes in - Ash and Mary-Lynette are soulmates, but unlike Smith's other couples, the two can't stand each other.But something about this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the overly drawn out murder mystery. Or maybe it was that the main character, Mary-Lynette, seemed dry. Or maybe even what seemed interesting - soulmates disliking each other - somehow doesn't fit in a series that's about finding your soulmate.1/5.

I love the whole idea of vampires, witches, and shapeshifters existing. I love looking at the stars like she does. If you enjoy this book, you HAVE to read the other books in the series.

review/summary: The best Night World book - definately
review/text: This has got to be the best book I have ever read in my entire life. I thought it was really different how Mary-Lynette and Ash tried to ignore the fact that they were soulmates, and it made the story much more interesting to read. Personally, I never would have guessed that it was Jeremy who had killed the girls aunt 'cause he seemed like a relly nice guy, but I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. I really wish that there was a sequel to this book 'cause I really want to find out what happens with Ash and Mary-Lynette. This is definately the best Night World book - although they are all excellent. ~Mary

review/summary: Wow! L.J. Smith is definitely my new favorite author!
review/text: I loved this book so much! I couldn't put it down for a minute. I've read almost all of the Nightworld series, but this by far is the best. The humor and the romance that brings Ash and Mary-Lynette together is great. The ending was kind of sad though. I would definitely read any sequels to this book. I hope that there is one. For those people who think the soulmate principle is getting old, I disagree. The author should keep the theory, but add a few new twists or plots to provide conflict and interest.

review/summary: Cameo Appearances
review/text: This was the first book that I read in the series and I loved it! I've read it about ten times. It's such a great book. I like how Ash is suddenly turned into a complete sap after meeting his Mary-Lynette. Did anyone notice that in the other two appearances that he made (in Dark Angel and Soulmate), he talks about his soulmate? Just something to think about.

review/text: I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is &quot;This is a paranormal disaster area!&quot;

review/summary: The best so far
review/text: I have read all of the Night world series up to number 9 (10 isn't out yet) and i really did like this one the best. I liked the rivalry between Ash and Jeremy, but don't think it should really be that severe. How could the two races get along, even if the vamps were more powerful, or the wolves are stupid? I have to admit the only corny part is the fact that the two pairs of soulmates are related. I just really liked this book, and think it is the best yet. I do want to see what happens to all of them later on, like say at the begining of the the battle to save the world. I just want to come back to see that Mary-Linnette and Mark are vamps, etc.

I liked Kestrel the best and wished she could be featured in her own book. I like the family history and all that. L.J has really thought all this out it seems. I also the like the plot and clonficts and how it's rexolved. I am glad that Mary-Lynette is going to do her own thing for the time being. I do reasllly want to know what happens with them though.

review/summary: Night World
review/text: I asked my sister one day to go and buy all the L.J SMITH titles I don't have.She is my favorite author because she is original and her books are spellbinding.Anyways, I got the NIGHT WORLD books. I read THE SECRET VAMPIRE and I really loved it. Then I read DAUGHTHERS OF DARKNESS and loved it more. I am a hopeless romantic and I love stories about adventure and death. I like the way she mixes both of them together without going overboard. She is my favorite author but I really wish that she could make her books come out monthly.And I wish that she could include other stories besides the soulmate principal. Like maybe a vampire killer as the main character.A totally wicked character that loves to kill. Maybe she could bring us what she feels goes through a killer's mind. There's a lot of other ways she could make us love her books,maybe if she described the NIGHT WORLD more. Maybe stopping and making the females a lot stronger instead of pitiful weaklings. Maybe they should be open-minded about becoming a vampire.Anyways, she's my favorite author and I love her books.

review/summary: the BEST nightworld ever!
review/text: It was dangerously funny. It mixed love in horror in a way Ithought never possible. I LOVE the character Ash. Actually, all thecharacters were facinating with a touch of there own. I hate the books that all the characters have the same, identical personalities to the point you're about to throw-up and this was not one of them,. My favorate part was when the sisters are hissing at Ash and Mary-Lynnette goes right up to him and kicks him in the shin and she descrides that her brother stared at her as if she had just stripped down naked and started to dance the Tango.

review/summary: Night World - Book Two
review/text: Daughters of DarknessL.J. Smith1996I continue to be surprised by how overally well-written the "Night World" books are, collectively. For young people in particular, they are quality fiction.Three young female vampires come to tiny Briar Creek, Oregon, to live with their also-vampire elderly aunt, but homicide is the word of the day, and curious neighbors Mark and Mary-Lynette quickly find themselves ensconced in the dangerous waters of the Night World -- and the even more unpredictable currents of love.I didn't quite like "Daughters" as much as "Secret Vampire", the first book in the series. The tale had a bit less... urgency... than its predecessor, and while I did like the redemption of Ash, bad-boy blonde from the first novel, the character development was again a little underexplored. But the world-building is pleasant and well-done, without info-dumping on young readers with potentially short attention spans.Again I can't help but wonder what a greater length could have done for the series -- "Daughters' "plot is a bit simplistic. The ending felt... unsatisfying.But without doubt worth a read, as I will wager the entire series will be.6.8/10

It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!

review/text: It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!

This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J.

review/summary: best of the Night World books
review/text: Jade, Kestrel, and Rowan, three vampire sisters, have left their home in secrecy. Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt. Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it. Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back. Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash. Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book. It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity). This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond. I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers. Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn't just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot. The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn't really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says. This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette.

review/summary: Daughters of Darkness, a love story in a supernatural series
review/text: Personally, I feel this book is the best in the Night World series, because I love the character Ash. He is such a hottie, though he has many personality flaws and actions to be ashamed of. That just makes him a more realistic character. Mary-Lynette and the rest of the characters are well thought-out also, and I hope to read about them in the future. This is my favorite series of L.J. Smith's, because in incorporates all creatures of the night. I look forward to reading Huntress and Black Dawn, since I've read all the other Night World books numerous times already, to indulge my fantasy craving mind. My only disappointment is that there are no shapeshifter soulmates. They must be just as intriguing as witches and vampires. And why can't I find Volume one of the Vampire Diaries anywhere? That series must be out of print, though it isn't old

review/summary: Murder, mystery, werewolves, vampire and soulmates
review/text: Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).

review/summary: Worth a read
review/text: Book 2 of the Night World series, Daughters of Darkness, shifts focus to a new set of characters of the secret society. Relatives of James from the first book, we meet Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade. They are three vampire sisters who snuck away from home. Tired of the secret society, they want to try to live as humans out in Oregon. They move into a dilapidated old home, next to Mark and Mary-Lynette Carter. As Jade and Mark get closer, their brother Ash comes to town to bring his sisters back. Of course, he meets Mary-Lynette and things get interesting...Ash, the handsome blondie who we remember from the first book as being a conniving, selfish, and manipulative, experiences a bit of growth in this book. In the first book you would have never thought it would happen, but I was glad to see the character development.What I like about the Night World books is that while you could read each book separately as a stand-alone, it's great to see prior plot lines and character weaved into the current story. It makes you feel even more connected to the story and the world.These books are short reads, but I find them pretty satisfying because the plot moves along and it focuses on what you really want to see.

review/summary: Vampires And Mystery? You'd Be Surprised
review/text: Mary-Lynnette's wants seem simple enough. She likes her quiet life, stargazes as a hobby, bases her life around becoming an astronomer, and hopes the three new girls moving in next door with the kindly, if eccentric, Mrs. Burdock will help to bring her shy brother, Mark, out of his shell.Unfortunately, what she ends up with is a murder mystery, romance she doesn't want, and oh, yeah, those three new girls are vampires with a dangerous older brother coming to drag them back home.There are a LOT of characters to focus on, as per usual with a murder mystery. We have Mary-Lynnette, Mark, the three sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade, their brother Ash, and the local werewolf, Jeremy. And those aren't even the suspects. The endless supply of characters in such a short amount of pages is a little overwhelming, with so many aspects of so many characters not fully explored. But what really gets the reader, even the fans of over ten years, is the star-crossed attraction between Mary-Lynnette and Ash.It's a bumpy road, to put it lightly. Mary-Lynnette is a simple, if nosy, human girl, while Ash is a dangerous, well-known vampire--and not well-known in the good sense, in Mary-Lynnette's book. Understandable; in Secret Vampire and Daughters of Darkness it's implied he's killed human girls and worse. There are very subtle hints at sexual abuse toward human females that younger readers may miss, but the words are enough to paint a picture that Ash is Very Bad.Many fans complain at the ending, but it is the ending that keeps them so captivated with these two. Mary-Lynnette wants to finish high school. She can't see herself with Ash as he is now, knowing his past. Ash is sorry and wants to repent, by the end of the novel, but wanting isn't enough. Mary-Lynnette is dealing with a soulmate who is potentially mentally unstable, definitely cruel, and by all human means, a classified felon (if he could be traced, that is).L.J. Smith did well in ending the story with no conclusion (which she has promised the fans would come at the end of the series for years; ten years later and still nothing). Ash needs room to grow in order to be someone Mary-Lynnette will not regret willingly falling in love with.This is a good book, by no means the best, but excellent for the series. It was the second book I read (no, Secret Vampire was not the first) and ultimately the one that got me hooked.Here's to hoping the Mary-Lynnette/Ash fans get closure in the near future. Publishers, don't keep faithful fans in suspense!

review/summary: Excellent, one of the best
review/text: I, LOVE this book. It is by far the best of L.J.Smiths Night World books. I can only find one flaw. No-one, and i mean no-one would just let a hunky guy like Ash just walk away? I mean Come On! As if. OK so what he's done some bad things but hey, you'll get over it. What if something happens to him while he's away and the last thing you said was "nice line". But okay that's fine, you wanna let him go? OK. But when do we get to find out if and when he and Mary Lynette get back together? That's just mean not telling us that. But besides that downfall the book was excellent and I love the way L.J.Smith described how they all turned really beautiful after they had fed. Heeheehee.Neways gotta go, hope you all enjoy/d the book as much as I did.Jess

review/text: This is my favorite book in L.J. Smith's uniformly excellent Night World Series. I've read it about a million times, and it never gets tired. I love the romance between Mary Lynette and Ash. The idea of soulmates is very exciting, and the scenes between the two of them are perfect. My favorite part is when Mary Lynette quotes Pride and Prejudice and Ash responds the same way, shocking her. Sigh. If you haven't read this book, get thee to a bookstore, a library, whatever and start right away!

review/summary: One of my favourites
review/text: In Daughters of Darkness, LJ Smith outdoes herself. Three beautiful sisters hide a deadly secret that threatens to be discovered by the inhabitants of a sleepy town. Rowan, Kestrel and Jade are on the run - from their families and from the Elders. They know that their brother Ash (James' cousin from Secret Vampire) is seeking them and that he is bent on returning them to the boring life they have led.Two siblings chance upon their secret and find themselves befriending vampires. As they learn more about the Night World, their own lives are turned upside down by a sickening deed. Who or what is it that stalks Briar Creek?Fantastic! I enjoyed this book immensely with its portrayal of two very different and yet similar families. The obvious difference is the species but the vampire girls have never had true freedom before while Mary-Lynette and Mark have lived their lives in a small town in the country. The similarities lie in the older sisters. Both fiercely protective of their siblings, they will do anything to keep them from harm.I loved the conflict between Ash and M'Lin, especially when they first meet. The story progressed well and unlike some stories, had a more convincing ending, rather than the sudden death of the baddie. This was one of my favourites in the series and I am still waiting anxiously for Strange Fate, which is the 10th.

review/text: Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!

review/summary: One of her best in the Night World series!
review/text: Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it.

review/summary: It is the best book in the series.
review/text: This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book.

review/text: You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible.

Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: Thought you would never ever fall in love? So did the hero (if you can call him that) of this story. Ash doesn't particularly like the idea of having to chase his little sisters across the country after they ran away from home. And when he finds them he doesn't exactly love the idea that they have also told humans about the Night World, a secret society of the supernatural. Or the idea that his youngest sister is in love with a human. But what's worse is Ash's soulmate is a smart, beautiful human from a hick town who hates him and everything he stands for. Also, what's worse, his great-aunt is killed with a stake meaning that somebody knew she was a vampire. All this adds up to the worst thing that can happen to a teenage boy who wants to prove that he hates humans, loves fast cars and even faster girls. This is the funniest, most ludicrous book you could ever expect to read from L.J.Smith. The characters are SOO familiar, you might expect to see them in school the next day. A must read for readers of all ages and COMEDY CENTRAL lovers.

review/summary: THE ABSOUITE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: L J really outdid herself this time, this was undoubtedly one of the best books she has ever written. if you dont have this book, or don't like it, there is something serouisly wrong with your head, and you need to go see a doctor ASAP!!! I love the part where Ash and Beth are walking in the woods. What they both say and do are and is soooooo roamanitic. I always wish that the night world were real!! I wish I could have a vampire soulmate, the idea of becoming a vampire is really cool, i would love to become one. I don't know whats wrong with Beath!! You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books. And hey, if u know any of her fan club addresses, e-mail me. I only just discovered the wonder that is LJ Smith. I only have 4 of her books, but am ordering the rest soon. THANK Y O U ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: The best of the Night World books
review/text: Why can't Ash be real? I am so in love with him. I think L.J. Smith should stop writing the Night World series. Its watered down. The only really good book was Daughters of Darkness (the Chosen was good too) I think she should stick to triologies, so we can become really attached to those characters, i.e. Julian (still not over his death) Gabriel, Nick, and Stefan. Read all of her trilogies...even better than all her Night World stuff.

review/text: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!

review/text: I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???

review/text: I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has

Smith, and I can't wait until &quot;Huntress&quot; comes out. I just started reading her books last summer. I have since then tried to read all her books and recruit my friends to get hooked. Ash and Mary-Lynnette are extremely convincing characters, as are all the characters from the book. You can really see Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade from Lisa J.'s descriptions. You can totally understand the characters, and can almost believe they are real! READ THIS BOOK

Dughters of Darkness (as well as any Night World book or the Vampire Diaries trilogy) should be required reading for anyone who believes in Vampires (or thinks they are one *grin*). Happy reading

review/summary: Another wonderful book!!!
review/text: Mary-Lynette was just a normal girl that loved the night. Until she meets three vampire sisters that are fugitives from the Night World. Then she meets their brother, Ash, a true vampire. He's come back for his sisters. Then, when he shakes hands with Mary-Lynette, he finds his soulmate, a human, which he called vermin. He wants her more than anything, and he wont leave her. He asks her if she wants to become a vampire, to go with him, but she says no. The vampires aunt had been staked when they arrived, and then a staked goat shows up on their front porch. Who staked them? Is it a vampire hunter or a vampire? Will Mary-Lynette go with Ash? Or had destiny made a mistake making them soulmates?This is a wonderful book. I couldnt believe who it was that was the killer. The ending I couldnt believe either.

Her bravery towards the cat like ash blond boy is amusing and gives the story a great twist. Reluctant lovers. This book has humor, suspense, and a bit of a murder mystery. Oh yah and a pincushion goat. What more could you want. Oh yeah , I'll mention Ash again! ( ohh and I have to say that the covers of the Night world seris in Europe do the book much more justice!!!)

review/text: I admit, the story was great. But it was also tiring. I think it needs more description about the surroundings, and the characters. I admit, it's nice to have little soulmates wandering the world blissfully, but I was really glad that in this book, it wasn't the case. But despite that nice turn of events, it does not change the fact that, well, this book tends to asume everyone likes happy endings full of love. Those endings are great, but I felt this one could have used a twist, or unusual ending. Instead of the evil vampire being reformed and changed, maybe he should leave in a rage or something like that However, I still hope you'll read it, after all, it is entertainment.

review/summary: The best Night World book ever!!!!
review/text: &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; was the first book in the Night World series that I ever read (and the second book by LJ Smith) and it just got me hooked. I think it was Ash that did it. He's so amazingly wonderful! (Along with Gabriel, Quinn, and Julian.) L.J. Smith is a terrific writer, and all of her books have good character development and description (especially of the guys). Not to mention that this book was hilarious at times. I was cracking up during Mary-Lynnette's encounters with Ash. And to think, I almost didn't read this book after I took it out of the library! It's a good thing I had nothing to do that day! Read it, and any other L.J. Smith book you can get your hands on! -LEX

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead.

review/summary: Great puzzles, bad format
review/text: I really enjoy doing the type of puzzles in this book, but I've come to realize that having them in a large-format book with wire binding is an absolute necessity. All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper.

review/summary: Fun little book of puzzles
review/text: For those who are fans of 'Paint by Numbers,' a puzzle that has taken the world by storm over the past decade, this book doesn't disappoint. Filled with lots of different art puzzles with the simplest of clues (a series of numbers), the final result never ceases to astonish.The one nit-pick I have is that the book is small, meaning the puzzles don't get that big either. As the puzzle has grown in popularity, so has the size of the puzzle, creating a more challenging atmosphere. These puzzles, by comparison, feel more like a beginner's version. But they're still fun and the results are, as usual, cool.

review/summary: A superb snapshot of Colonial America up to 1750.
review/text: The brilliant historian Richard Hofstadter was working on this book when he died in 1970. In eight highly readable chapters he presents clear discussions of several areas of Colonial America, among them: the explosion in population, the diverse ethnicity, the world of white indentured servents, black slavery and its trade, along with a discussion of the predominant middle class life many enjoyed, and finishes with three fine chapters on Colonial religion and the Great Awakening. His mastery of his subject matter and the clarity of his writing is a joy. The Scotch-Irish, the German religious sects who were excellent farmers, the terrified blacks kidnapped and marched 550 miles to the coast and into slavery, the desperate white indentured servents selling themselves into virtual slavery for a time, the always extremely dangerous ocean crossings, the greedy-yet terrified slaveholders and the cruel slave codes they wrote, the relatively prosperous Americans, the coming of G! ! eorge Whitefield--America's most spectacular preacher, the religious schisms that the Great Awakening brought: all these stories are here. And all packed into a highly readable book. A pleasure to read. Thank you Professor Hofstadter.

review/summary: a sadly incomplete yet fully realized work
review/text: This is a magnificent work of historical imagination. Hofstadter's last book, it was what was to begin a much larger, possibly three volume epic on the social conditions of America at distinctive periods in our history. And while this book is missing the fuller vision of a more articulated society, the chapters that are present are truly alive with insight and understanding of the way things probably were. Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can't help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing).

review/summary: mirroring the reader
review/text: I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece.

review/summary: An Enlightening Step in All Americans' Past
review/text: One of History's saddest events, I mean in the discipline of History, was the premature death of Richard Hofstader.With this book, the last he wrote, not finishing it, he also was making a turn in his writing career. Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was "God," now it is sometimes "God" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self.

review/summary: Time again to read the liberal idea of America
review/text: AMERICA AT 1750: A Social Portrait, by Richard Hofstadter. 293 pages. Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: "Anti-intellectualism in American Life": "The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays"; "Social Darwinism in American Thought"; "The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States."When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as "America at 1750" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in "The Middle Class World."One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren't even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start.

review/summary: Breaks Up the Monotony, In My Opinion
review/text: To give you a little insight on my opinion, I was assigned to do an "outside reading" for my U.S. History class and I picked this out of the list of acceptable books. This book really does pack a lot of information into it for you, and it breaks up the monotony of facts and locations by throwing in little stories, examples, and quotes, which give history a little more "personal" feeling. The first chapter is a real snoozer, dealing mostly in population figures and growth, but it picks up from there. I also found the last few chapters on religion and the Great Awakening a little redundant, but still interesting.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: Unfortunately I only read the introduction to this book before buying, and it sounded like it was exactly what I was looking for: a book to tell me all the cool places to go in the city that one might not normally find. I'm new to Chicago, and I want to find the places to go off the beaten path.I wish I had skimmed the book before I bought it. In this book, the author reviews places he feels one needs to see. Review after review of restaurants and clubs and stores, the author used descriptions like, "decent" and "nondescript." In one review, he claims he is "a tad ambivalent" about that specific restaurant, and in another, he reviews a bar as being the sort that "you never want to go to but find yourself in anyway." Even the places he talked about positively, he never got excited about them. The most you'll get is a restaurant that serves food that is "quite good." He spends a good chunk of the book talking about how he is an "old man" now, and talks about things he did when he was young and what the neighborhoods of Chicago were like years ago, and in many of his reviews he admits that he hasn't been to that place in some time. This is fine if that's what you are looking for, but I would recommend a book on Chicago history if that's the case. The last straw was a review of a resale shop that ACTUALLY starts out with, "Nothing special." Why include this in your book of places "you want to know about" if it is nothing special? I stopped reading the book after that listing, and it went straight in the trash. Worthless.

review/summary: The Sleeping Boy by Barbara J. Stewart
review/text: Every once in awhile, amazing, complex and believable characters are born - Annie Shannon is one of those characters. Most women can relate to her on some level. A real woman with regrets, who doesn't have to be beautiful, rich or famous to be a central character in a book. I hope she will be a recurring character and that this wonderful new author will bring her back into our lives again and again.Stewart tells a gripping tale that hooked me from the first page to the very last. You get to know Stewart's characters so well that you visualize them clearly without having to be told what they're wearing that day or how they style their hair. She captures the essence of their personalities and makes them so believable that the reader buys into their motivations within the unfolding plot. The plot that unfolds is full of twists and turns keeping the reader guessing to the very last page. A remarkable accomplishment!!I highly recommend this new book - a compelling read. I hope we'll see much more from Barbara J. Stewart.

review/text: Many people may disagree with me, but I think this book is not suitable for children. The images are taunting and very nicely rendered, however, there are some strong hidden meanings within them. Such as the imagery of soldier and violent, and especially the general's black leather glove (maybe symbolic to the idea of totalism?).What interest me the most is the climax of the story; when the boy and his family falls into sleep, and they wake up when peace finally arrives to the country. I want to know why that symbolizes in the story, what is the author trying to describe or proof to the reader?I think this is a book quite dangerous for parents to read for their kids at bedtime, unless you go further in describing them the history and cross-meanings of the book--perhaps that is complete package of the book, and what the author want every parent or teacher to do.

The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher.

The book should be read by those interested in a first hand view of the civil war as seen through the eyes of an ordinary man (2nd in command under Chamberlain). It provides great insight into what daily life was like during the war. I found this book to be extremely moving...it made me proud of as well as grateful to those that lived through conditions most of us could never even imagine.

review/summary: First-Rate Recollections of the Civil War
review/text: John J. Pullen, in his seminal work "The Twentieth Maine" describes Ellis Spear as a determined man with a dry sense of humor, the kind to "take the convervative view of men and events." Ellis Spear, a schoolteacher prior to the war, joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant in 1862. He would over the course of the Civil War rise to the commissioned rank of Colonel and the brevet rank of Brigadier General, a remarkable performance for a man with no prior military training. His duties with the 20th Maine would take him everywhere the Union Army of the Potomac traveled from late 1862 through Appomattox in 1865. As a Major, Spear was often the day-to-day commander of the 20th after August 1863.The 20th Maine is rather more famous than most volunteer regiments, thanks to its heroic fight on Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettyburg, a stand dramatized by Jeff Shaara in the novel "Killer Angels" and in the movie "Gettysburg." Spear's recollection of that day varies in the details from the traditional account presented by Pullen but this probably says more about how confusing a battle can be, especially when recollected thirty or forty years later, than about any real contradition in facts."Recollections" actually has three parts: Spear's notes jotted down during the war itself; a first attempt at writing them up in narrative form around 1896, and a more finished attempt undertaken sometime after 1900. The post-1900 attempt is the most readable, and is presented first. It should be read in close conjunction with the end notes to understand the context in which Spear was writing. A comparison with the other versions provides an interesting lesson in historiography.Spear's recollections document the life of the regiment in camp and on campaign. He details the challenges posed by the weather, the terrain, the poor food, the often indifferent leadership, and the Confederates themselves. Spear writes in a matter-of-fact manner, interspersed with the kind of understated dry humor well-known to those who have lived in Down East Maine. His story is a remarkable tribute to the toughness of Civil War volunteers, who soldiered under sometimes appallingly bad conditions with grumpy good humor and perseverence. Spear comes across in this narrative as a dedicated, common sense officer who conscientiously carries out his duties. Spear's gift for observation captures, among other events, some excellent vignettes of the temporary truces established by opposing picket lines, the sometimes strange persistence of good manners in the midst of war, and the inherent brutality of combat.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and to casual readers looking for a sense of the times.

review/summary: The Food of Love
review/text: A tale of tangled relationships and excellent food! Laura is an American student studying in Italy, and has decided to take the advice of her Italian friend and will date only men who can cook. Tommaso and Bruno are friends who both have their eye on the beautiful Laura. Tommaso has lied, convincing her he is a chef and is dating Laura, while Bruno secretly cooks for them and looks on enviously in the background. The situation is bound to get out of control as the deceptions build.This novel is a trip to Rome through smells and flavours. I absolutely loved reading about the food, Anthony Capella describes the aromas, looks, and tastes so well it's as though you're right there in Italy. This is the main attraction of the novel for me, although the plot was interesting as well. Bravo!

review/text: Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying.

review/summary: Fun
review/text: I bought this book for $1 at a Barnes and Noble clearance table. I shelved it for about a year while I read other books. I finally grabbed it off of my bookshelf one day last week after I finished another book and couldn't think of anything else to read. It was worth the wait. I devoured this book in a matter of hours. Yes, it is an easy read, yes, it is not a DEEP book, but it is a fun book that makes me want to visit Italy and savor some REAL Italian food, drink some espresso, eat some gelato and stare at hot Italian men. I am glad to have read a fun romance written by a man. It is easy to tell that it was a male author and it is a welcome change from all of the drama of a female romance novel. The characters were predictable, the plot as well but I am so glad somebody wrote a book just to write something fun and not because of some hidden agenda with a "meaning". This book is worth way more than what I paid for it. It is worth list price and I don't say that often.

review/text: First,it's a juicy love story. Second, it's an interesting off-beat tour of Italy. Third, and most important to me, it reveals once and for all that haute cuisine is not an exclusive property of the French. Italian cooking is tremendously varied and rich, and this book makes that clear. Read the "Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini" and you'll understand that the French court learned to cook from the Italians.

review/text: I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a "trifle overdone" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons.

review/summary: A Scrumptious Romp
review/text: This is a fabulous novel.It's about two young Italians who fall in love with the same American student in Rome. The American's a fox, knows it, and would normally be unattainable, but for the fact that she's a fool for good food. So her handsome but shallow Italian admirer convinces his best friend, a shy and slightly morose chef, to dazzle the woman with some exquisite cooking, for which the callow one takes credit.This the shy chef does, with remarkable results, since he also falls in love with the American woman (gazing from afar), and his suddenly-inspired cooking evokes the full range of emotions that she awakens in his heart.This segment also includes some wonderful discussions of classic Roman cuisine.So...that's the set-up, and the rest of the book does not disappoint.Unfortunately the book starts slowly, with some awkward writing. But if you hang in through the first twenty pages the writing suddenly turns crisp, the pace quickens, the plot takes some delightful and unanticipated turns; and you find yourself at a banquet, savoring a remarkable meal that's about the awakening and refinement of the only appetite that matters.It's tragic that a book this good is already out of print.

review/text: THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.

review/summary: The Food of Love
review/text: "The Food of Love" is a great book: romantic, funny, and sweet. While it is technically a variation of the Cyrano de Bergerac story, it is much less tragic and I found the three central characters to be much more lovable. Tomasso is the good-looking Italian charmer in love with American Laura. He can't cook, but his less good-looking friend Bruno can, so Tomasso uses Bruno's cooking skills to woo Laura. Of course, Bruno is also in love with Laura but she has no idea it's him cooking her all the wonderful meals. The story takes place in Italy with nice descriptions of scenery and food. I like light, chick-lit kinds of books along with serious stuff, and I thought this wasn't stupid or mindless like a lot of romance books. I really enjoyed the first three-quarters of the book, but the last few chapters (and especially the very end) weren't quite as good as the beginning. There were also a few plot twists, such as one involving the Mafia, that I didn't think were necessary. However, I found this book hard to put down and would definitely recommend it.

review/text: Food, especially Italian food, and love. Just the thought makes me drown in the shear yumminess. This is a very fun book, written with wit and sensuality and lovely, lovely longing. While this in no way compromises the joy of a book in which the descriptions of food easily overwhelm not only readers, but the characters as well, those same characters do become ever so slightly tedious late in the book. But read on! There are near-recipes right through to the end. The writer looks forward to further food fables from author Capella, who demonstrates influences from Garcia Marquez, Allende, Esquival, Lily Prior, and Joanne Harris, all of whose readers would readily enjoy this book.

Everything is "the best ever experienced" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.

review/summary: Not as good as I Expected
review/text: Unlike the other reviewers, I was disappointed with this book. The author's passion is clearly food -- his writing is at its most vibrant and vivid when he's describing the cooking scenes, or Bruno's hunts at the market for the food he uses to prepare the next meal for Laura... I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish. Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary. In fact, it detracted. As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses. Especially in the beginning of he book, it was almost as though he trotted out every one that he knew just because he knew it. Cussing is like hot sauce -- a little goes a long way.

review/text: This first novel by Anthony Capella is a fresh and sassy romp of a love story. Very Italian, very gourmet, very funny, very sexy, it's a perfectly delightful summer read, a mini holiday in Italia. Witty, satirical in places, sad in other places, but ultimately satisfying, Capella has captured personalities with style and precision. It reminded me of nothing so much as a Shakespearean comedy, not so much in terms of literary value, but with respect to its bawdiness, its charm and its humor. Delicioso and molto buffo! Bravo to the author - can't wait to read his next offering.

review/text: Bruno is not just an Italian cook, who can prepare dishes from typical recipes, he is a chef who gathers ingredients and creates his own masterpieces of flavors. However, he is not confident in other areas of his life, such as love. When his roommate and friend, Tommaso, asks for his help to seduce an American tourist by secretely preparing wonderful meals for her, Bruno doesn't see the harm in agreeing to let Tommaso take the credit. Little does he know that the American woman, Laura, is the same one he has been watching in the local markets. Bruno creates foods that show his feelings, but Laura believes that Tommaso is the chef. What is she really falling for? The food that Bruno passionately prepares or Tommaso?It is a joy for any reader who loves food to read about the dishes that Bruno creates. This was a yummy book because of the delicacies and because of the love story. The author, Anthony Capella, really knows his Italian food! I highly recommend it! It is a great new addition to the food and fiction category.

review/summary: A lip smacking, delicious story all the way!
review/text: She put down the spoon, amazed. It was all gone. She had eaten it without being aware of eating, her mind in a reverie."Did you like it?"She looked up. Somehow she wasn't surprised. "What was it?" she asked."It doesn't have a name," Bruno said. "It's just... it's just the food of love." [Page 255]This romantic comedy, mainly set in Rome, is an enjoyable tale of two Italian men who romance an American student with food. Although a very different story, a part of the theme is reminiscent of "Cyrano de Bergerac."Reading THE FOOD OF LOVE will leave you dreaming about a visit to Italy, a fine Italian meal, perhaps preparing a meal of your own, and the sentiments of romance.I enjoyed every single page of the story. From the moment I picked up the book, if I wasn't chuckling, I had a smile on my face.The vivid description of characters, neighborhood, and locales reminded me of my time in Italy as study-abroad student. Each character was engaging and authentic - from the protagonists to the secondary characters.I loved the restaurant/kitchen scenes; the descriptions of Bruno shopping and cooking; and the scenes of the small Italian town where he found some solace.I got a kick out of the Italian sayings and their translations: Parla comme t'ha fatto mammeta. Translation: Speak as your mother showed you - i.e., Cut the [bull]. [Page 36]. Applied in appropriate segments, they were funny and added to the make up of the characters that used them. I could envision Tomasso and Bruno talking like that.Along with a happy ending, the story finishes with a few simple recipes. Normally, I don't cook, but I was inspired to try making some of the dishes. I'm happy to write that my cooking endeavors were a success.Cleverly written, THE FOOD OF LOVE is a recommended read.Fafa Demasio

review/summary: Gastronomic delights
review/text: For any kind of foodie or to anyone who delights in Italian cuisine, this book is a must. Tommaso is a handsome, very Italian looking young man who attracts girls like flies to honey, but who especially appreciates the charms of blonde, non-Italian females. He works as a waiter at one of Rome's most up market restuarants and shares an apartment with his old friend, Bruno, a rather plain looking man who happens to be a brilliant and inspired chef. Laura is an American art history student, in Rome on a scholarship, determined to follow the advice of her Italian girlfriend to find herself a boyfriend who is a chef, as they're supposed to be "good with their hands". When Laura and Tommaso meet, he introduces himself as a chef and a Cyrano de Bergerac situation occurs with Bruno cooking incredibly wonderful, sensual meals for Laura, for Tommaso to pass off as his own work. It's an engagingly light read, full of descriptions of mouth watering Italian dishes, overlaid with love and laughter, perhaps not for those readers who aren't at all interested in enjoying good food...and there are such people...but for those who enjoy the use of all of their senses, a sheer delight!

review/summary: Book of Chance
review/text: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.

review/summary: Light reading, light in substance
review/text: A clich&eacute;d storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the clich&eacute; for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.

review/summary: The food is sexier than the sex
review/text: This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.

We are both of Italian decent & grew up together in a mostly Italian neighborhoood as children; and still friends today. This book hit home. It was so entertaining, I couldn't wait to get home from work at night just to read more. Loved the little Italian phrases throughout ... I continuously laughed.

review/summary: Cyrano de Bergerac goes to Rome
review/text: I read this last week on a long-haul flight - perfect diversion on a noisy, crowded plane with indifferent plastic airline food!This is a take on the famous Cyrano story where an inarticulate man in love speaks to the love of his life through the only means at his disposal: in this case cooking rather than poetry.Bruno loves Laura who loves Tommaso who really could not give a damn about anyone except himself. Put them all into the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant, throw in a few comic extras (the college teacher with neuroses about food, the barrista determined to brew the best cup of coffee in the universe, "quaint" Mafioso, etc), add in a diversion in the rural depths of Le Marche and you have a very jolly read.If you like food, then you can smell the cooking and taste the flavours as they can only be experienced in Italy. You can walk the back streets, visit the markets and learn about the great Roman love of traditional food.My only criticism is that Laura is perhaps a bit over-drawn: she is too obviously a character created by a man rather than a woman and reminded me a little too much of the much admired Nigella Lawson.I agree with the reviewer who enjoyed the little asides of very rude Italian slang - a guide on what not to say when in Rome!I will most certainly be looking for other books by this most welcome new author.

review/summary: The Case of the Double Murder
review/text: In Chapter 1 Gil Adrian walks into the Oaks Restaurant. Gil has been accused of bribing city and state politicians, and being connected to organized crime. A stranger joins him, and they begin to leave. Suddenly, Gil shoots this stranger and takes off in his black Mercedes. The police are called, and go to Adrian's house. They find Gil's wife outside, enter the house, and find Gil dead in the den from two shots to his head! [Gardner always played down the background corruption in his stories. The idea of a double murder popped into to my mind.] Chapter 2 provides an example of wrongful conviction, which happens more often than the dramas on TV would suggest. This is an omen for Chapter 3, where Mrs. Gil Adrian, the trophy wife, retains Perry Mason. Laurel doesn't know much about Gil's business, or of any powerful enemies. Does the political establishment want to hang the murder on Laurel and thus bury the scandal? Mason learns the stranger Gil shot was unidentified; all he had was cash, a phony driver's license, and a .22 pistol strapped to his ankle. Wasn't a .22 pistol the weapon of choice for hit men asks Mason? Mason contacts David Niles, a Federal prosecutor, and suggests an alliance. [This never happened in the original series, to my recollection.]Chapter 8 tells of the beating that was given to Paul Drake Jr. after he questions Anselmo Costa in Las Vegas. Perry Mason also visits Las Vegas to ask questions, but learns little more. The preliminary hearing in Chapter 19 is as good as Gardner's best. It tells why a defendant shouldn't wear sunglasses. Chapter 20 explains why getting testimony about 'Karl Braundorff' was important. This led to Janet Coleman, a 'roper' (like Raymond Schindler), who told of Gil Adrian's visit to Las Vegas. Then Anselmo Costa is summoned to the witness stand, but he asserts his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Perry Mason gets a clue from the artist drawings on TV. The bank is subpoenaed to find the last check written by Ralph Adrian, Gil's son, before Ralph was murdered. These clues help to solve the puzzle, and Laurel Adrian is freed.This story brings in updated procedures (the defense gets a list of the prosecutor's witnesses), and mentions the terrible traffic in Los Angeles since the 1960s. But the flavor of the original stories has been lost. Paul Drake has retired, and Perry Mason would be an octogenarian, if still alive. What is missing is a younger lawyer, Perry Jr. or Della Mason, to carry on the father's work. This story is like a good reproduction of an old master like Rembrandt, but in a modern setting. It lacks the dedications that were part of the original series.

review/summary: An enjoyable story if you can accept the new style
review/text: The Perry Mason stories by Erle Stanley Gardner were written in such a distinctive style that it is easy to recognize and hard to mimic. Therefore, any fan of Perry Mason will have to accept the disappointment of reading this Mason book by another author of another time. Gardner's style and tone very much that of the thirties and forties, with different terminology and a different level of acceptance regarding how men looked at women.If you are capable of accepting the significant difference in style, then this book can be enjoyed. Some of the characters are changed, for example it is now Paul Drake Jr. doing the investigations and Ray Dallas has replaced Lieutenant Tragg. The hostility between Mason and the police has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect, within the bounds of their professional rivalry; Ray Dallas and Mason are friends.The story is formulaic of the Mason stories, a man is murdered and his estranged wife is falsely accused of the murder. Mason must piece together a series of sometimes-contradictory clues in order to unmask the guilty and free his client. In true Mason fashion, his questioning of a witness leads to a dramatic courtroom event where the murderer is revealed.Although Gardner wrote many Perry Mason stories and they follow a pattern, there are reasons to always want additional stories. Chastain's effort is a worthy addition to this set, while naturally different, it is still within the bounds of what a Perry Mason story should be.

review/summary: Not too much, not too little, but JUST RIGHT
review/text: Everything you ever wanted to know about management reporting but had no way to ask. The author presents clear, motivated examples of ways to do exactly what the title says: convert mountains of raw data into a few gems of useful information. He presents ways to process data to reveals trends, identify &quot;unusual events&quot;, and to remove the effects of seasonalization from data. But more importantly, he presents approaches for formatting and organizing information so that it is clear and action-oriented. That is, so that instead of looking at a bunch of numbers and going, &quot;Hmm&quot;, your reports are effectively &quot;to-do&quot; lists of things you can act on as a manager.The book is brief, but in this case, more is less. Everything is explained with crystal clarity for both managers and IT folks. If you are designing any kind of management reporting system, either as its user or its software developer, you MUST READ THIS BOOK. Plus, it's short enough that you'll have enough time left over to read the (also short) book &quot;One Page Management&quot; to reinforce this book's points about exception reporting.

review/summary: Good reference material
review/text: This is a great book to have next to your "Dictionary of Cultural Literacy" and your "Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations." It lists several expressions, alphabetically, and includes not not a general explanation and easy to understand pronunciation, but also cultural context as well. There are also several excellent appendices, including polite phrases in several languages, common French ballet terms, and 13 ways to call someone a loser in Yiddish.My only concern is that it is somewhat Eurocentric. This is not too surprising since the majority of foreign words and phrases used in English are European in origin, but still - you can count on one hand the non-European phrases. The only Japanese words included are nisei and sensai, and I would have expected wabi-sabi and umami at least to be included as well. There are no phrases from Native American languages, none from Africa or the Middle East. There is a fair amount of phrases from Hindu and Sanscrit, but since there were introduced to the English language during the British occupation of India, I don't know whether they can really be considered foreign phrases.

review/summary: A MUST FOR EVERY PARENT !!!!
review/text: I purchased this book not knowing much about it. Let me tell you...I am sooo glad that I did !!! I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a "good day". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the "I know" , "Nice try" and "I love you too much to argue". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!! Thank you Jim Fay - I hope I can meet you to thank you in person someday!!

review/text: I've given this book to quite a few people. Basically, here's what I got out of this book:It's loving to let your children experience the consequences of their own actions. You WANT your children to become strong, responsibly adults--so you need to let them develop the skills they need to succeed on their own.You also want to do so in a way that is LOVING and not coming across as punishing or the bad guy. It's such a tricky act. But once you learn this (and you'll find it VERY successful) you can apply it to your children, your SPOUSE, and your COWORKERS!

review/summary: Simplified version of Love and Logic
review/text: I am a big fan of Love and Logic and have several of the books already. I enjoy sitting down with a 200+ page book, but not so my husband. I have been trying to get him on board with the Love and Logic program, but he will not sit and read a book for that long! So when I saw this book, I thought it might peak his interest enough to get him to read it. This book is much shorter than some of the others and it thoroughly addresses problems associated with discipline. As with all of their books, there are lots of anecdotal stories with clear examples. He still didn't read the whole book, but he did walk away with a better understanding of the methods used. I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again. I keep this book handy just to remind myself to keep up with the program. It is much easier to quickly skim this short book than break out the original love and logic book and search for discipline. since beginning the program almost 2 years ago, parenting has been a lot more fun! I am also a teacher and these are great strategies! Wonderful supplement or stand alone book for Love and Logic!

review/summary: Don't let the ignorance of the previous reviewer deter you from this valuable resource!
review/text: Not sure what the other reader was talking about. I am an agnostic so I am pretty aware of that kind of thing. I was also a teacher. Not only does Love and Logic work in the classroom but it does amazing things with my kids. I have 2 toddlers and I think the Love and Logic books and videos are an indespensible resource. It seems to me that the previous reviewer was just looking for a forum to rant about something totally unrelated to these books. He also wasn't reviewing this book - I guess some people will actually mislead people to try and get their voice heard. If click on "see my other reviews" under his name you will see that he has reviewed every book in the Love and Logic series with this rhetoric that is based on complete ignorance. Charles Fay and Foster Cline (founders of Love and Logic) are from Evergreen Colorado - not Colorado Springs and have nothing to do with the whole "family first" thing. There is no affiliation whatsoever. Again, not sure what the other reviewer was talking about - but it is a shame that he may turn people away from a resource that is the most effective tool I have come across to raise children who are responsible, able to make choices effectively, have great self-esteem, and to avoid all the arguments and power struggles that come with parenting.

It is a small book, easy read that captures the essence and equips you with all the parenting tools you need! No matter if you are the parent of a toddler or a teenager, this book will be inspiring and helpful. ENJOY.

review/summary: Great Ideas
review/text: I not too long ago learned of the LOVE and LOGIC philosophy and I LOVE it!! I have since gotten my hands on as much of these books that pertain to my family and children as I can!! Jim Fay has really got some great ideas. And they work!! Even if you're not really "In Crisis" with your family or a specific member, this is good to get to 'be prepared'. And maybe if more parents used these ways early on then they would never get to the 'in crisis' stage - wouldn't that be great??!! The idea of this philosophy is to NOT make the parent the Bad Guy for punishing the kid. It puts it back on the kid - WHERE IT BELONGS!! They also have classes on this that you can take at schools taught by other parents and there are seminars by the authors of these books too.

review/summary: &quot;Dinner at Antoine's: An Intriguing Mystery Set in New Orlea
review/text: &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; written by Frances Parkinson Keyes is set in New Orleans during Carnival Season in January 1948. It is a mystery that endures the generations. I first read &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; ten years ago in 1990. I enjoyed the book so much that it inspired me to make a trip to the Crescent City. My love for the book has not died since that first reading.The mystery is terrific. When I began my second read of the book in May 2000, I was quickly swept into the plot. I didn't want to stop reading. The book is so well written that the characters, plot and setting come to life before the reader. As Ruth Avery, the main character, sees New Orleans for the first time, I too saw the city for the first time through her eyes. The author gives a complete picture of New Orleans society in 1948 through the many characters that she develops. Joe Racina and his wife Judith are middle class residents. Joe works as a reporter and Judith maintains their home. Judith has chosen not to hire help as she grew up in Connecticut on a farm. To the opposite extreme you have the Lanlande family at the top of society. Other characters include Russell Aldridge, architect; Vance Perrault, doctor; and Tossie Pride, personal maid. &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is an old fashion murder mystery that in the style of Agatha Christie is full of suspects. Once again I was intrigued until the end as I remained unsure of the murderer's identity until it was revealed. This book is by far the author's best and it makes you beg for a sequel.The added bonus to &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; are the physical descriptions of landmarks in New Orleans. The descriptions are so great that this book could almost be categorized as a travel essay. When I traveled to New Orleans, I used &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; as my guide. I quickly found Antoine's Restaurant and in the restaurant I found the Rex Room, 1840 Room, and Mystery Room just as the restaurant had been described by the author. The French bread, tomato aspic, oysters Foch, flaming pressed duck with cream and brandy, cherries Jubilee, and caf&eacute; brulot all enticingly described by the author can still be found on the menu. I quickly moved on throughout New Orleans finding the Court of the Two Sisters, Caf&eacute; Du Monde, the French Market, Jackson Square, the cathedral, St. Charles Avenue, the Garden District, Audubon Park, and the Metaire Cemetery. My most recent reading of the book has me wanting to return to discover the River Road and to find out if the Bar None Restaurant exists with its barbecued chicken, onion rings and corn fritters. Even if I find that the River Road and Bar None only exist in the author's imagination, she has so aptly described them that I will always feel as if I have actually visited.Reading &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is the perfect way to spend a weekend when you want to take a luxurious vacation in the comfort of your home.

review/summary: Entertaining tale of old New Orleans
review/text: Half soap, half Agatha Christie mystery, this story of New Orleans in the late 1940s is a charming and compelling story of love, deception, and murder. Populated by a complex and endearing (or repelling) cast of characters, this is an excellent story. (And why isn't it in print?!)Starting off at the restaurant Antoine's, it follows extremely rich playboy Orson Foxworth (yes, that is his real name) introducing his lovely niece Ruth Avery to the rich'n'famous of New Orleans. Among them are the beautiful Amelie Lalande, a self-absorbed but very lovely widow that Foxworth wants as a lover but is willing to marry; Odile St. Amand, Amelie's daughter, who is suffering from a disease she tries to hide; Leonce St. Amand, Odile's philandering husband; Caresse Lalande, Odile's little sister who is on the brink of a full-fledged affair with Leonce; Vance Perrault, a doctor who cares deeply for Odile; Odile's ex-lover, Sabin Duplessis; Joe Racina, a brilliant journalist, and many many others...After a fateful night where Odile's shaking hands cause her to spill wine on herself (similar to a bloodstain), Amelie refuses Foxworth's proposal as she doesn't want to leave her poor invalid daughter alone, and Leonce attempts a seduction. Motives are abundant when Odile is found dead in her bedroom - shot through the heart with a gift from her ex-lover. Many lives and destinies will change (some for the better, some for worse) before Odile's killer finds justice of a sort...The pace is pleasant and gradual, allowing us excellent insight into the characters. The descriptions of luxurious houses, restaurants and clothing (especially clothing!) are evocative and entertaining. No threads are left untangled, and the question of motive and reason is, frankly, as excellent as that of the Grand Mistress of Mystery, Agatha Christie.There is only one thing that kept this from being a five-star book: As it was written in 1948, this book has a rather stereotyped portrayal of African Americans, especially Odile's loving nurse Tossie. Despite the stereotype, I was pleased that Tossie was not played for laughs and was one of the more insightful characters in the story. The reader automatically connects with her (especially regarding her low, low, LOW opinion of Leonce) and is warmed by the last chapter regarding her.Though Ruth Avery is sort of the heroine, she is nevertheless not the central character. She is strong and independent, with little thought of social position; and, after Odile's murder, so is Caresse (whom I expected to hate but ended up liking). I hated Leonce, was charmed by Orson Foxworth and Joe Racina. I found the character of Amelie Lalande to be highly annoying, with her self-centered artificiality.Though there are a few pitfalls in this book, it is nevertheless an entertaining (and pretty clean as well) story about mystery and passion in New Orleans, a beautiful city. Well worth the read.

review/summary: A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine's
review/text: If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called "Madame Castel's Lodger," which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller

The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948).

review/summary: Decoy Mystery
review/text: Picked this recently from Grandmother's shelf; she'd never read it, but her few months living in New Orleans were right around the time of the book. It will be hard for enlightened readers to believe that upper /lower classes would behave and communicate in stereotyped ways; umbrage is mis-taken. Not only can you trust an observant outsider resident of New Orleans writing in 1948 to have a perspective on 1948 New Orleans superior in details to that of postmodern criticism, but it's also easily forgotten by outsiders, even after this hurricane, that, in this city more than any other, people lived their lives in one or two neighborhoods. In other words, life itself was, from an educational standpoint, simplistic and regressive. Craving high-mindedness, a fatalistic New Orleanian you never will be. It's faintly surprising that people want it dressed up. This work sure doesn't oblige (attention to fashion and finery notwithstanding). Most of its characters do suit a place so set'n its ways that, even as the book was being written, leadership was passing to the smaller (later giant), more creative city that would eventually come to N.O.'s aid from a few hundred miles to the west.It would be standard (and a bit inaccurate) to say the setting is a character here. However, I will say something you rarely hear: stories exist so that the author has something on which to put the real communication. Forget the mystery. I'm nogood at figuring them out, yet I did. That's not what to read for. I read to soak in the place, the author's devotion to it, and then it just fits that the most humbly local person, the part of the tapestry the astute reader kept expecting to find dirt on, is revealed to have been good all along.

review/summary: Very dated and predictable mystery
review/text: I decided to read this book after a visit to New Orleans when I toured the home of the author. The book was mentioned during the tour as one of her most famous books.I can see why it is out of print. I almost quit reading it after 50 pages. To become classics, books need to have universal qualities that transcend time and place. Dinner at Antoines is filled with stereotypes.As another reviewer pointed out, the depiction of blacks in the novel is condescending and dated. They all talk like characters in "Uncle Remus."The blacks are not the only ones who talk like caricatures. The policeman Murphy talks like an Irish cop from the movies.Other characters also are stereotypes. They are the ruthless businessman (Foxworth), the shallow woman out for his money (Amelie), the noble statesman (Huntington), the philandering husband (Leonce), the flirt (Caresse), Latin beauty (Clarinda), caring old doctor the tough-talking policeman, the rugged archeologist, etc. None of them seemed real to me.The main women characters are interested only in clothes and men. Ruth is a rich 20-something clothes horse with a silver mink coat. Clarinda is considered an old maid at 27. Caresse goes to New York to become a model for a staid department store. None of them seems to have a brain.The plot also seemed a little creaky to me. I figured out "who done it" about half way through the book, even though many characters had a motive and there were clues pointing at several. I also easily figured out who would marry whom at the end.Another plot flaw is tha author does a lot of telling readers about characters and what is going on rather than demonstrating it by action.Most of the plot takes place over a week, yet a murder is comitted and solved, an engagement takes place and is broken and replaced by another, and Ruth agrees to fly to Hondourus marry a man she has known a week.As an example of 1950s race, class, and gender stereotypes taken to an extreme, the book is interesting. It was somewhat entertaining, but totally unbelievable. I did not believe in the world portrayed.That is the main difference between a classic like Agatha Christie's novels and this book. I believe in the worlds Christie creates, though they are set in past times and distant places. However, I feel that Parkinson's New Orleans is an unbelievable place with unbelievable people.

review/summary: The Truth About Homeopathy
review/text: Julian Winston's novel is the most in-depth and informative discussion on homeopathy that I have come across. The book makes good on its claim to insightfully delve into the fundamental philosophy of homeopathy. Also, Winston tackles the important and controversial question of scientific rigor that plagues this medical breakthrough. He makes it systematically clear how the medical philosophy of homeopathy is scientifically rigorous. Also mentioned are the innovative medical thinkers known as the original homoeopaths, the decline of homeopathy at the beginning of the 20th century, and the resurgence of this medical philosophy towards the end of this same century. It is ideal for those readers attempting to gain greater medical recognition of homeopathy or for those just interested in the history of this innovative healthcare technique. If one is looking for in-depth inforamtion on homeopathy that is historical, academic, and interesting, then The Faces of Homeopathy is in my opinion the best book to buy.

review/summary: Among the best technical books I've ever read
review/text: I laid my hands on this book about 3 years ago when I was already an accomplished webmaster. People like me who already know HTML and supporting technologies like CSS will defenitely rue the fact that they didn't lay their hands on this book earlier. Beginners this is the only book you'll need on HTML for a long while.My fundamentals were accumulated as a result of many books on this subject as well as the effort of scanning millions of emails on mailing lists. All in all sheer experience. The author has done it all for you. It's all there in one place, follow this book and you'll end up not making too many mistakes.I often get people asking me about something or the other regarding HTML / client side web development. I always refer them to this book. And no their queries aren't as simple as &quot;What are the params for an anchor tag?&quot;. That any book on HTML can answer. It would be more like &quot;I just can't get this page to have the same gap between two tables. All my code is perfect, I'm at my wits end!&quot;. The answer would be something only an expert can point out, like &quot;Hey you have a newline between your tables in your code. Yes HTML doesn't care about newlines but some browsers do.&quot;Truly this book will answer a lot of questions like that. If you ever are gonna work with HTML or have been working with HTML but haven't read this book, your eyes will be opened either by the fact that you didn't know so many things, or by the fact that a human being could stuff so many facts into a single book.If you are the type who needs a pocket reference maybe you are at the wrong place, but then perhaps you'd demand a pocket reference for building a space craft too! This book is a must for anyone who needs a sense of how web building works.I last encountered this book in 1998 but I just felt like putting it down now, and I still recommend it. There isn't a better book on the subject.

review/summary: Omissions Diminish Usability as Reference
review/text: There are numerous problems with this book as an HTML &quot;reference.&quot;First, an irritation for anyone using this book as a practical reference to look up tag details is that looking up tags is needlessly inefficient. They're supposedly all in the 250-page Appendix A, but to find one you have to go to the Appendix A section in the table of contents at the beginning of this bulky 1100-page tome, look up the page # listed there, then go to that page. The obvious alternative would be phonebook-style page headers showing the first tag name on each page so readers could locate a tag of interest directly. Why wouldn't a tech book publisher have this figured out?The cover says &quot;up-to-date for latest versions&quot; of Netscape and IE without specifying dates or version #'s. The printing date is hidden in the ISBN code. I find this practice questionable.Although pages 7 and 682 say all documents should begin with &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, this tag does not seem to be fully described anywhere. The syntax suggested on p. 682 (with a single pair of quotes) conflicts with the HTML 4 examples on p. 60.The book cover trumpets &quot;comprehensive&quot; coverage of HTML 4 as well as: &quot;extensive details on Cascading Style Sheets 1 &amp; 2.&quot; One could be forgiven for figuring this means fairly full coverage of CSS. However, the preface draws a distinction between HTML and CSS, speaking of &quot;HTML 4 ... _along with_ new technologies that affect HTML, such as CSS ...&quot; and announces an intention &quot;to do one thing the best I can: cover HTML.&quot; The implicit disclaimer is not idle. Whatever the process that upgraded the previous edition to this one, this book is by no means a comprehensive reference for CSS.

review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST HTML BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!
review/text: Despite being over 1,000 pages this book really teaches html in a simple practical way. It has lots of examples for beginners and a great reference for more experienced HTML programmers. If you want to Learn HTML this book is the only book you will need. Once you read it you will ready to read the O'Reily series' JavaScript book by David Flanagan and you will also have a great understanding of CSS1 and some understanding of CSS2. I have read alot of HTML books in my day and this is the most complete of all the books and the easiest to read of all the HTML books I have encountered. It's a hell of a BOOK!

review/summary: Fantastic Advanced Course!
review/text: Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced.

review/summary: The Title Says it all
review/text: I should just leave it at that, but I won't. When I got this book I was completly blind to the world of HTML, but now I have mastered it. This book starts off teaching the basics, like how to start your HTML document with the HEAD and BODY tags, and goes all the way into using HTML tables to design your website and using HTML forms. By the end of the book, I knew everything, and was able to move onto more advanced subjects such as PHP or CGI-scripting. This book is the perfect way to get started if you're interested in pursuing a career in web development or application programming. However, if you are not interested in learning HTML, this book is not for you. It is a complete reference and you need to read the entire book to take advantage of it. If you really want to learn HTML then buy this book, because it will be the first and the last you will ever need.

review/summary: Excellent learning and reference book
review/text: I've been using this book for a while now, and I have to say that its one of the best written computer reference books that I've ever had the pleasure to use. Its extremely comprehensive and well organized, with lots of clear examples. It even covers some of the basics of JavaScript and CGI (though you'll still probably want/need another book that covers those topics exclusively, if you're interested in them.)Probably the only real complaint that I would have about the book is that its HUGE. There's some sections in the book that probably could quite easily have been cut or shrunk down. I kind of got the feeling that they wanted to stretch the book out to 1200 pages as a marketting "Look at how huge our book is!" thing. They probably could have made it ~1000 pages rather easily, which would have made the book easier to handle.In addition, some sections of the book are somewhat outdated. That's an unfortunate fact of life with books of this nature, though. Overall, though, the book is still very accurate.

review/summary: Great Book For All levels of Sit Design
review/text: I've made several web sites, and I am pretty much fluent in HTML, Javascript....and have learned a great deal about producing a decent site. This book has is not just a reference, it has site theory which will open a lot of peoples eyes' whom have already produced web sites in the past. I consider this book more of a course instead of a reference book which one refers to when they need to know a certain tag or command to get what they want. The reason why I gave this book 4 stars, is becuaes this is the only html book I thought was worth buying (esp. compared to other HTML books which ran up to 60 dollars) and have not read any other books on this subject. I would suggest this book to anyone who is interested in Site design....I think the name is wrong when it says html complete reference, it does have an excellent reference section but the material in it is invaluable to any type of site your making and with any type of language/script you are using.

review/summary: The only HTML book you really need
review/text: If you can only have one book on HTML, this is the book to have. No other book I've seen covers HTML and related subjects as well as this one. In addition to HTML, the author covers XHTML, briefly discusses XML, covers basic JavaScript and both CSS (style sheet) specifications as well, in addition to DHTML, which has permeated the Internet.Despite its size and the magnitude of the material presented, the book is logically organized and well thought out, starting from basic and easy material and progressing in difficulty. There are several ways the material could have been organized, and as an experienced HTML writer I would have organized it differently, but I believe the author's organization makes the material more accessible for new and less experienced developers.Any criticisms I may have of this book are very minor compared to the excellent job the author has done with this book, and I would recommend it for anyone who has to write HTML, with or without the aid of an HTML editor.

review/summary: Add Improved Functionality to any Website!
review/text: There are still some folks around like myself who prefer to design Websites and pages using raw HTML &quot;coding.&quot; Windows Notepad is still my top HTML editor of choice. However, whether folks prefer to &quot;code their own&quot; or use standard HTML editing programs, there are clear advantages of becoming familiar with the basics of HTML programming that will pay dividends in the long run. Not all HTML editors are created equal and sometimes inside knowledge is helpful in the Web development process.HTML: The Complete Reference is a huge 2 1/4 - inch book packed with helpful and important HTML Web design information. Here readers will take in a broad scope of Website programming features that will improve, freshen up, and add functionality to any Website. Learn how to use fonts, colors, backgrounds, frames, tables, layers, style sheets, client-side programming, plug-ins, audio and video clips, and more. Plenty of scripting examples are provided to permit immediate results in the Website design process.This reference book includes all the latest tags, Web browser and programming compatibility considerations, and background information needed to produce outstanding Websites. The book reads better as a reference guide than a novel. However, one can learn quite a bit by simply thumbing through it on a casual basis. A particular Web design feature could leap out from a page and arouse interest that could lead to a great design idea!This book recommended for experienced programmers only, who are well acquainted with the in's and out's of Web design concepts. It's a great reference book to have on hand when a programming matter arises or when some changes must take place to liven things up!

review/summary: HTML made easy
review/text: When I decided I wanted to learn all I could about HTML I went looking for a good book on the subject. I never buy the first thing I see and I spent many hours researching for the best I could find. My search narrowed down to just a few and this book won the toss. I am truly impressed at what I found here. I purchased several books on related topics (javascript and such) and after reading all of them, this book was, by far, the easiest to use. Mr. Powell's writing style allowed me to retain more than I expected I would. I immediately put into use many of these tags to take my website from average to very efficient (and cool if I do say so myself). The reference section allows me to quickly find more about the tag I am trying to use. Don't let the enormous size of this book intimidate you. It reads easy and a great deal of the book is reference relating back to what you learned earlier.If you are using a WYSISYG editor to make your website and want to get past those limitations. This IS the book you want. If you don't buy this book RIGHT NOW, you will someday wish you had. Do it while it's fresh in your head.

review/summary: The Only HTML Text You will Need
review/text: When learning a new subject, I sometimes find it helpful to begin with a Visual Quickstart or Sam's Teach Yourself, then an intermediate text (if needed), and finally an O'Reilly Nutshell or Wrox Professional to deepen understanding and use as a reference.Powell's Complete Reference on HTML performs the task of all three levels.The first 212 pages, "Web Basics," save beginners the need for an "HTML for Dummies." The next 475 pages provide a well-organized presentation of HTML mechanics including presentation, layout, cascading style sheets, client/server side programming, DHTML, XML, and web hosting. Throughout this material, sample code is presented and explained to illustrate the concepts presented. Finally, 430 pages of appendices provide reference level detail that will remain valuable indefinitely.The later chapters (programming, DHTML, XML) are overview in nature. (ASP is discussed in five pages.) This is appropriate, for each of these subjects requires a text of their own. The overviews are valuable as they present these subjects in the context of HTML and how they can work together. They also give the reader a basic platform from which to study in greater detail.Certainly worth mentioning also are the numerous tips and valuable remarks sprinkled throughout the book. In my case there were several one-line statements worth the purchase price.This book is a well-written and thorough text that a beginner can use to learn HTML and an advanced web developer can use as a reference or to polish up. I can't compare this with others books on the subject. It hasn't been necessary to read any.

review/summary: I bought this book after reading these reviews...
review/text: and I have been quite satisfied.Although I don't think a &quot;Complete&quot; reference book on programming, especially HTML, can exist, this is as complete and updated as it gets.Being a professional and advanced programmer I might be tempted to claim this as the best book there is, but for beginners I suggest they start with a book which is more of a &quot;tutorial&quot; than a &quot;reference&quot;. A smaller book that puts more emphasis on &quot;teaching&quot; the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource. But after that I strongly suggest they get this book.Remember, no single programming book can ever be a good reference while being a good tutorial. And we need both.

review/summary: A comprehensive and &quot;user-friendly&quot; guide to HTML/DHTML
review/text: &quot;HTML: The Complete Reference, Second Edition&quot;, by Thomas A. PowellOur NST/Engineers company reviewers found this over 1000 page compendium to be an ideal training text and desktop reference for a wide spectrum of web page designers. Individuals working to improve company intranet and extranet communications will be well-served by the examples given of code and scripting followed by what you can expect to see. Professionals seeking guidance in advanced HTML, DHTML, XML, and related internet savvy can expect to increase their understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.We found excellent coverage of the pitfalls of page preparation without knowledge of the differences between popular browser capabilities. The browser versions expected to be in common use for the next few years of Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, WebTV, and a few others, and how to allow for their different interpreting capabilities , is covered throughout the book.Hundreds of pages of appendixes explain what you can and can't do with HTML elements and style sheets. The function, power, and use of Java Script in its several variations are explained with examples. Author Thomas A. Powell, an expert Web consultant and Internet applications teacher at University of California at San Diego, explains the centrality of HTML while predicting changes that XML and other methods may bring in the future. He cites lots of free online Web sites, at all levels, to augment material in the book.We found the writing style, loaded with useful examples and stabs of humor, to be an easy read. This is a body of knowledge that must be understood at higher than an entry level by industrial, academic, and small business practitioners alike who see the need for an effective Web presence.

review/summary: Not Good Enough
review/text: I bought this book based on the Amazon Reviews and after using it I must disagree with the weight of on-line opinion. Not that it is a bad book. It just isn't what the reviews led me to expect. My main disappointment is the poor structure and organization. It has a thrown-together feel, more like a collection of separate and poorly integrated sections than a single well-organized book.Some examples: Even after marking the page edges it is still difficult to find what I want quickly. The text sections are only average and not at all comprehensive. To learn HTML or CSS, you'd be better off getting a book (or books) that is not trying to be everything at once. And the reference sections are also a disappointment. The main headers do not stand out from the repeated subheadings so one becomes lost easily. There is not enough detail on differences between the major browsers. The CSS &quot;reference&quot; is a mess. It is broken into subsections which disrupt the alphabetical order and is sorely lacking in the kind of detail that is critical to successful style-sheet implementation.As I said, it's not a bad book. It's just not good enough. For total newbies, Castro's QuickStart Guide is far superior. On CSS, try O'Reilly's &quot;definitive&quot; guide. Not sure what to recommend as an HTML reference. I'm going to try Goodman's &quot;Dynamic HTML.&quot;

This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.

review/summary: Not as good as the 2nd Edition
review/text: This is a great book but I didn't think it was as good as the previous edition.Firstly I found a few too many errors that would trip up beginners to HTML/CSS. I checked the errata section of the website but not a single error in the book was listed there (at the time of writing this). I can't believe they are unaware of them, especially as this book has been out for several months now.Secondly the author keeps plugging his other book, so much so that he includes an entire chapter from that book here. Although it may of had some relevance I don't think it should of been added, as in my opinion it was clearly intended as a promotion of his other publication. I certainly don't object to being made aware of an authors publications, for instance in a list at the end of the book, but not like this.On the plus side this book does cover HTML exceptionally well, all the expected stuff like frames, tables, layers, forms, links, media types etc are explored. XHTML is also covered but don't expect much, the differences are only in the rules of writing the language, which are explained. Note that there isn't a chapter dedicated to XHTML but you are made aware of the differences between HTML mark-up and XHTML mark-up when necessary.Like previous editions this book does cover a lot of theory, e.g. logical versus physical mark-up, protocols, mime types, parsed html etc.There is also a chapter dedicated to CSS1 and CSS2 which is pretty complete. The CSS2 section includes coverage on the various new pseudo elements and selectors introduced in CSS2. There is also a reference section covering CSS1 and CSS2 at the back of the book, and it includes proprietary properties for Internet Explorer.SSI is also covered in this book. There are also very basic introductions to XML, JavaScript, server side technologies and DHTML. These are more about what they can do as opposed to teaching you them.The reference section has been organised alphabetically this time, so it is much easier to use than previous editions. They include coverage of XHTML, additions to WebTV, JavaScript event handlers and the usual HTML stuff. There are also reference sections for colour codes and character entities.Finally this is the first Complete Reference book I have purchased that didn't fall apart, so there is no need to buy a binder this time around.

review/summary: Excellent - Good for beginners, comprehensive
review/text: Before reading this book (this was the required text for a class in HTML), I had some very basic experience with HTML. I found it easy to read and remember the concepts, as they are presented in a straight-forward way, with an emphasis on real-world scenarios. The tips the author provides are valuable... I found myself using them a lot at work and on several projects. Because my previous HTML knowledge was so scattered, reading the book put my thoughts into place and provide a more formal picture of HTML and css. This book also addresses cascading style sheets and is loading with information. At this point I use it as a reference, the css appendix is comprehensive, tho I think the layout could have been done better-- some area are tough to read.

review/summary: Handy, but has redundancy
review/text: One of the flaws of this book is that the author has to make every point two times. For example, the structure of an Internet Protocol address is covered twice in two separate sections, for a total of 10+ pages. I find that addressing has been adequately covered in other HTML books in 2-3 pages. As another example, the author mentions a trick of prefetching an image by rendering it with a height of 1 and width of 1. This trick is mentioned in full detail (paragraphs) twice in two seperate sections.The author seems to feel that every chapter should be complete in that it covers all tricks. For a reader who reads several chapters at a time, sections become redundant. I agree with the reviewer who said that the book could have been shortened ~100 pages with no loss of value or continuity.

I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details.

review/summary: An intelligent and well-structured guide to HTML
review/text: This book should rapidly become a standard reference work for anyone working with HTML. Given that the World Wide Web is something of a moveable feast, and given that HTML will probably be very different in ten years time, nevertheless Thomas Powell has put together a superb manual that presents information in a clear and concise fashion. His writing style is clear and articulate without the verbosity that is sometimes associated with what is, after all, a potentially complex subject. Information is easy to find and well indexed and the examples are copious. Mr Powell is also to be congratulated for creating a work that should appeal to beginner and expert alike. In short, just about the best work on HTML around - I just wish I'd bought the hard-back version as my copy is looking decidedly tatty because of the use it gets!

review/summary: Excellent coverage for both beginning and advanced users
review/text: This book was the first HTML book I ever purchased, and unless a change is made to the language, will be the only one I ever need. I was a newcomer to raw HTML coding before I bought this book, and it has proven to be an invaluable learning tool and reference. The coverage of the language is excellent, and the section on Style Sheets is very in-depth. Also, the appendicies at the end of the book contain complete information on every HTML tag and their associated attributes for quick look-up.Although this book can be a little difficult to get started, once you get past the introductory chapters and into the section on actual HTML code it is very straighforward. It provides many code examples along with the results produced, which in my opinion is one of the best ways to teach any language.I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn HTML as a hobby or for business - it covers everything you will need to know.

review/summary: Makes designing and updating web pages a snap!
review/text: In the computer industry the internet is an enormous entity. Web Pages and web page development drive the internet. Everyone developing web pages wants to make their page better than everyone else. Thomas Powell has taken a great deal of time and given the go to reference book that makes that job easier.The book will help to develop the simple web page or if you are a web master you can use this text to create a work of art. You have the opportunity to learn DHTML, XML and integrate your work with Cold Fusion and other web applications.Powell gives you a breakdown of each tag, form, frame layout, table setup, font reference, sheet styles and so much more. There is a never-ending use for this book and from the novice to the expert. Everyone can learn something.A small edition to the book might be a cd-rom with various web utilities and special effects for pages, but other than that you will be hard pressed to find a more complete reference manual. This book needs to at your side from beginning to end and every step in between.

review/summary: Good Overview
review/text: This book is good in the sense that it introduces HTML and HTML commands. The biggest flaw in this book, however, is the lack of emphasis on XHTML. The cover boasts that it includes full XHTML within it; however, it is really only one chapter out of the whole book. As someone who likes to keep up with the W3C standards and current technology on web pages, I have found that out of this entire book, I really only use chapter 13 which is on style sheets. I read the book and got to this chapter only to realize that everything I had just read wasn't information I could use.This book also includes an introduction to other aspects of HTML such as JavaScript and Server Side Programming, as well as, web maintenance. However, it only serves as an introduction and points the reader to other books. This book is great as an overview, but it does a poor job at helping you move from reading about HTML to actually doing the current HTML you would see on your favorite website.I would recommend finding a book on CSS and XHTML that gives a short introduction to the basics of HTML and then gives more emphasis on the current technology being used.

review/summary: Not a horrible place to start.
review/text: I actually bought and read the &quot;The Complete Reference HTML second edition&quot;.I'm sure they are similar with some slight additions explaining some newer browser compatibility issues and possible additions to HTML and the use of style sheets.The Second Edition was literally a bad book. My copy broke down and all the pages were falling out in clumps of about 50 pages making it tough to use.But the content of the book is simple. All or most of HTML uses, concepts and tags are explained one by one in a comprehensive manual-type book.Not a great Tutorial type book. Not really for beginners. This is definitly a great reference though. For those who know how to use HTML but need to &quot;checkup&quot; on some things sometimes this book is for them.

review/summary: The only HTML book you'll need
review/text: My first &quot;The Complete Reference&quot; book was for Java 1.0. I was so happy with that book that when I went looking for an HTML manual, the first one I looked at was this one. And it's a good thing I did, because it's the only book I ever need to look at for a reference. It really does contain everything I can think I would need to write HTML code at any level of complexity or depth, and I've been writing HTML code since 1994, professionally since around 1997. If you're a beginner, the book spends some time in the beginning teaching you the basics and concepts, everything you should need to get started on your first pages. And if you're a novice or expert, the book will scale to your level of knowledge gracefully, it covers the gamut, even extending into Cascading Style Sheets, Dynamic HTML and a brief introduction to XML (if you need an XML manual you should get one dedicated only to XML, this reference is not complete for that purpose). The title couldn't be more appropriate, as inside the book, there is a complete reference of every single valid HTML tag and attribute you could use, even including explanations for what each attribute means! If you get just one HTML book, get this one.Keep in mind that this book does not cover any WYSIWYG tools for creating HTML pages (such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver). This is just for writing the HTML yourself with a text editor, or to assist you in using the WYSIWYG tool of your choice, as most of them allow you to manipulate the HTML and attributes manually.

review/summary: Simply awesome
review/text: This book is just spectacular!I have been a web developer for several years now, and I have read many books about HTML and related subjects. This book covers it all. But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won't need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too.

review/summary: The only HTML book you'll ever need.
review/text: The first thing you'll notice about this book is its size, over 1000 pages for HTML, a bit much I first thought. However only the first few hundred pages cover HTML, and it's covered extremely well to. If you have read any other book on HTML then you won't believe just how much has been missed out until you read this book. HTML is much bigger than you would have ever thought.The book teaches you a lot of theory, areas such as logical and physical structure, doctype definitions, media types, encoding types (to name but a few) are explored, and the usual tutorials on tables, frames, linking, image maps, graphics, meta tags etc are all there, but more information is provided.There is also a chapter dedicated to style sheets which covers both CSS1 and CSS2. As HTML 4.0 encourages you to use style sheets instead of standard HTML, it was good to see this chapter. This was my first exposure to CSS and I'm very confident using it now. I don't believe you will have to buy an additional book on CSS.Other chapters include introductions to other technologies like JavaScript, server side programming, XML and DHTML, but these are only basic introductions, do not expect to learn these technologies from those chapters, they just give you a taste.The remainder of the book consists of the reference sections. These throughly cover (among other things) HTML and CSS. The HTML section includes additional tags and attributes specific to each browser, including those for webTv. Character encoding is also covered.I have only two criticisms of this book. Firstly it falls apart in your hands, so if you buy it expect to buy a binder as well. Secondly although the reference section is full and complete it isn't laid out very well.To sum up this book is both a tutorial and a reference and is always on my desk.I also own the third edition of this book but I don't think it is as good as this edition.

review/text: After looking over many reviews of HTML references, I bought this one. While I'm not diappointed I don't think it lives up to all of the 5 star ratings. Perhaps if you are considering constructing elaborate sites with CSS styles,etc this is a great book. It cetainly gives one an overview of the web but seems frequently light on examples for many of the most frequently used items. If you are trying to learn enough to tweak existing simple sites (my objective) then there is a lot of unnecessary stuff. I have to admit that the tone bothered me as well; it seems the author complained constantly that the web designers were not using HTML &quot;properly&quot; - too many workarounds, etc. Real life doesn't always conform with intent!I use the book as a reference but have found it easier to learn things from on-line sources and real life code.

review/summary: Why is there a Cosmic Decoy?
review/text: Book # 21 of this Space Opera is the beginning of a huge story arc, which concludes in Book # 41, "The Earth Dies".These mega-stories are called "bands" in the original German. This band deals with the first true encounter between the fledgling fleet of Terra and the might of the galactic empire.In "The Cosmic Decoy" we are reunited with Cadet Julian Tifflor, whom we met in the Mutant Master trilogy of stories. Cadet Tifflor is chosen by Perry Rhodan to become a Cosmic Decoy. At least four of the ships of the Terranian fleet have disappeared, and Rhodan wants to know where they went.In just the first book, we discover that the four missing ships were stolen by the Springers, a race of space-faring traders with no morals other than their own. Julian is prepared for this mission with a "secret" message - and a hidden special transmitter that is only capable of being received by people with telepathic powers, such as several members of Rhodan's Mutant Corps. Even Tifflor is unaware that he is a living psychic transmitter. According to plan, Tifflor is kidnapped by the Springers, but he is whisked away to a secret base before Rhodan and his men can catch up. We meet a few of the Springers and begin the process via which Rhodan plans to make the universe believe that the Earth has been destroyed.Next episode - Number 23 - "Fleet of the Springers".I've never been this impressed by a series. I'm reminded of old cliffhanger serials like "Buck Rodgers" or "Flash Gordon" when reading these marvelous books. This series is still being published in Germany and is now well over 2,000 stories. It's too bad American publishers stopped after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another letters column. There are also extra stories - one continuing adventure, similar to a serial, and some "Shock Shorts" - continuing a series of SF short stories at the end of each book. Although these stories have nothing to do with Perry Rhodan, they are worth looking at.It's well worth reading the entire Rhodan series.

review/summary: An Essential Book on Soviet Cinema
review/text: Anyone who wants to understand the movies of the Soviet Union should start with this book. It is very thorough and written in a lively, bright style that is free of academic jargon.Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets. He pays equal attention to the &quot;high art&quot; films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s, like &quot;Volga-Volga.&quot;) He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism, World War II, and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end, the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However, one should be thankful for what one has, and in this volume, one has a truly indispensible book.

review/summary: A multicultural, multigenerational story of acceptance
review/text: This is the story of three friends and their families. This trio consists of "multicultural rejects"; Justin "Jay" is the gay child of Chinese immigrants; Tien Ho, conceived out-of-wedlock during the Vietnamese War by a Vietnamese mother and African-American GI father; and Gibbo, a chubby, white, socially inept Australian who yearns to be Asain. Each character feels out of place in society and clings to each other only to find that they are even out of place with each other.After drifting apart for a few years, their parents take action to bring them together. They orchestrate a dinner to celebrate the life of Princess Diana and watch the live coverage of her funeral. During the course of the dinner, Justin is outed, Tien's fiance is knocked unconscious, everyone is ashamed when it occurs to them that they forgot Gibbo's birthday. And to top it off, the food is awful!Despite this disastrous dinner, it sets a series of events in motion to reconcile not only the three friends, but the families. In the worst of times, Justin's in a coma, Tien is getting divorced, and Gibbo is accused of being a stalker, they all come together to support each other.This book is captivating from the start and is wonderfully written. The author takes you on a journey with each character, bringing depth and perspective to the series of events. I came away from this book having learned something about people, life and relationships. For instance:Tien's mother, Lihn, in love with a black American solider, is rejected by her family for her love. In a letter to her father, she quotes a Vietnamese author I'd never heard of before, Nguyen Du:"It blows one day & rains the nextHow often does chance favor us in the Spring?If you ignore and scorn my desperate loveyou'll hurt me- yet what will it profit you?"The Tale of KieuThis passage struck me as relevant to my own life as many of my friends are in the stage of life where they are deciding who to spend the rest of their lives with. Not everyone is making good choices, in my opinion, and it's always difficult to know when you should speak up to prevent disaster and when to let people make their own mistakes. There were other passages and messages in this book that were thought provoking and had me reflecting on my life.As good of a book as this was, I still have to give it an overall rating of a 4-stars because of the ending. It was a little too....... happily ever after, for my taste.

review/summary: Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places
review/text: Hsu-Ming Teo's novel was published in Australia in 2005 and released in the US this year. It is basically a story about three friends with multi-cultural backgrounds. Justin Cheong is a Chinese-Australian who is the picture-perfect son. His world becomes increasingly unstable as he comes to terms with his attraction to other men. Tien is the child of a Vietnamese woman and an African-American soldier. Living with her aunt and uncle in Australia, she straddles worlds of identity between Asian culture, Australian culture and wondering about her American father. Gibbo is a Caucasian Australian whose culture serves as a foil to the Asian. Overweight, Gibbo lacks confidence. He bonds with Justin & Tien as outcasts.Teo sets up the classic "No Exit" triangle where Justin loves Gibbo, Gibbo loves Tien, and Tien loves Justin. After the elementary to high school years, the friends draw apart. Justin goes camping with Gibbo with unfortunate results. Tien goes to prom with Gibbo with unfortunate results. The novel reunites them toward the end of college @ the Dead Diana Dinner (DDD) where relatives gather to morn the loss of the British princess and watch her funeral on TV. Here, the parents begin to take center stage and we go through their history. Gibbo's mom has been like a mother to Tien, but backs off when Tien's mother Linh finally arrives in Australia from Vietnam, via a Malaysian refugee camp. Gibbo's dad is a brusque medical doctor who gets upset with Justin's dad Tek and spills the beans about Justin's sexual orientation. Meanwhile, everyone has forgotten that this is also the meek Gibbo's 21st birthday. Tien plans to announce her engagement to Stanley, but Gibbo's mom knocks him out thinking she's caught an intruder.From the DDD, the novels spends several chapter in flashback as we learn all about Linh's history and her love affair with American GI Bucky. We also flash forward to see Tien in San Francisco with her husband Stanley and follow them through his modern art phase and Tien's flirtation with a new age feminist group that enjoys giving themselves haircuts in private places. Justin's life resembles that country song, "Looking for love in all the wrong places." Meanwhile, Gibbo develops an unwelcome attachment to Linh.This episodic novel sounds a bit melodramatic, but reads well. The characters are distinct and interesting, although none are perfect. Teo tries wax philosophical about the weaving of relationships into a lifetime pattern. For me, the Asian cultural self-analysis was interesting as people from various cultural backgrounds try to establish their own roots. Enjoy!

After reading her book Johnnie Finds A Buddy, she read this book to the kids and they went wild. She taught them the "CLEAN HAND JIVE"- her song about washing your hands. At their school they teach the importance of washing your hands and even have a unit in science and their health classes about this topic. Most of the children do not find the topic of hand hygeine very interesting. To see the reaction of the kids after Michelle Bain read the book to the children my kids school we were pleasantly suprised. Finally, an author came up with a "spin" on hand hygeine that was funny and impactful at the same time. I hope that this writer tackles many of these subjects in the future!

review/summary: Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories
review/text: I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States.

review/summary: Climbing the rungs
review/text: The title of this book, `God was in the Place, & I, i Did not Know', may seem a bit cumbersome (and even, to some, looks like it has a typographical error. However, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner draws this title from the Torah, the book of Genesis to be precise. It is the exclamation of Jacob who, upon waking from his dream about the ladder connecting heaven and earth, makes a startling realisation about the reality of the seemingly mundane and ordinary place where he had stopped for the night.In the prologue, Kushner develops an exegesis and hermeneutic of Genesis 28:16 more fully, and in so doing, illustrates many of the problems we regularly encounter, both in reading scripture as well as in interpreting daily life experience. He places this story in strong connection with the ordinary, even relating the angels on the ladder to common humanity:`There is another, even more obvious interpretation. The angels did not reside in heaven at all. They lived on earth. They were ordinary human beings. And, like ordinary human beings, they shuttled back and forth between heaven and earth. The trick is to remember, after you descend, what you understood when you were high on the ladder.'Kushner examines the way in which sages have interpreted this passage, and provides insights into history, psychology, philosophy, and scriptural study in the process. Each interpretation has had what one might call a personal conversation and experience with Jacob. In fact, each of these interpreters is portrayed as being on the ladder, rising and descending. The text is structured in this way. The interpreters are:+RashiSchelomo ben Yitzhaki, RashiThe key word for this interpretation is awareness. This is very important for making the kind of realisation that Jacob made. It is very important for us as we perceive the presence of God in our own lives.If I had known God was here, I wouldn't have gone to sleep.+KotzkMenachem Mendl of KotzkThe key concept here is egotism. Only by stripping away the ego can one begin to understand the presence and the personality of God.God was here because I was able to subdue my ego.+LudomirHannah Rachel Werbermacher, the Maid of LudomirA remarkable woman, a teacher of the Hasidim (who listened to her teaching through a half-open door, so as to preserve distance, and perhaps preserve a fiction that they were not in fact being taught by a woman), whose insight gave her access to the other side, or the many other sides, of stories being considered.God is present, even in the midst of evil.+MezritchDov Baer, the Maggid of MezritchThe word Maggid means 'storyteller'. Through the stories, here the key is self-reflection, to find meaning in the innermost being, to find that still, small voice that can only speak in silence and the absence of our own activity.God was here because I stopped being aware of myself.+NachmaniShmuel bar MachmaniWho was Jacob, and why should he know this? Who is God, and why should God do this? These are questions that are historical as much as theological or psychological, and it is in our history and God's history that we find meaning and identity.I could have climbed this ladder of history.+De LeonMoses ben Shem Tov de LeonA remarkable book, lost for a time, whose existence was denied even by Moses de Leon's widow, the Zohar, gives astonishing insight into the interior of God, reality, and our selves, and how to find a deep connection that is always present and never finished. Attributed to another author, Shimon bar Yohai, Kushner speculates that perhaps they shared the same soul. The completeness of the self of the universe connects through Jacob's story here.I is the Lord your God+OstropolShimshon ben Pesach OstropolerBeyond the question and awareness of the self of God and the self of the universe is the self, basic and simple, complex and intricate. Rabbi Shimshon put names to the kelipot, the broken shards of creation. We are all a part of a whole, a broken piece in and of ourselves. Our awareness of this helps begin the process of reunion.I didn't know that my name was part of God's nameEach interpreter's chapter stands on its own merits, but each is connected to the other, and to a wider body of interpretation and scholarship, by the use of side notes and references done in (what I would describe as being) a proto-talmudic structure. The Talmud has been described by some as one of the world's first hypertexts, with cross-links and chains that lead through the text -- this book does similar linking.Rabbi Kushner concludes by linking all the stories to the reader:`Each person has a Torah, unique to that person, his or her innermost teaching. Some seem to know their Torahs very early in life and speak and sing them in a myriad of ways. Others spend their whole lives stammering, shaping and rehearsing them. Some are long, some are short. Some are intricate and poetic, others are only a few words, and still others can only be spoken through gesture and example. But every soul has a Torah.'The relative place of self (both as an I and as an i) in God's life and universe becomes more apparent through these stories. Human beings are important, yet who can be important in relation to God? Yet, who is not important in relation to God? May this work help you discern where God is in your life, and what you are called to be.

review/summary: The hand of God
review/text: As you have gathered from the main review, this book focuses on the meaning of just one verse in Genesis, when Jacob awoke from the ladder dream. Usually Rabbis pick up on a verse just a couple verses back where &quot;the Angels of God were going up and down the ladder&quot;. The focus is that they start on Earth and go to Heaven - not the other way around.This book is great because it is like there is a dialog accross the space-time continuumn with 7 Rabbis in different locations and centuries arguing about their 7 different interpretations.One interpretation based on the fact that there are two &quot;I's&quot; in the verse spelled differently in Hebrew. It is that my Godlike &quot;I&quot; did not know God was present because my ego &quot;i&quot; was in the way. Jacob's chance to experience God was diminished because the ego &quot;i&quot; was ragiling off its commentary. This concept is similar to Buddism.Kushner adds an 8th interpretaion in his prolouge - which I won't spoil by going into detail. I heard Kushner talk at a Synagouge in Austin, Texas and he summarized his interpretation by finishing, &quot;Hold up your hands before your eyes. You are looking at the hands of God.&quot;A great book on modern Jewish mystism.

review/summary: Poetic and Intelligent
review/text: Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, "You are all liars!"3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. "Too much concentration can be worse than none at all" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The "I did not know" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the "I."5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, "Frees slaves," and then "Call anytime" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the "I," the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, "God was in this place and I did not know it was i." We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent.

review/text: Rabbi Kushner takes a single line from the Torah and then gives seven traditional commentaries ranging from a 3rd century Palestinian rabbi to the &quot;Maid of Ludomir,&quot; who flourished 1500 years later. With each commentary, Kushner is able to shed light on a different aspect of God and extend each rabbinical reading into a comtemporary perspective. This is a marvelous melding of rabbinical scholarship and the renewed sense of spirituality in Judaism.

review/summary: A Recommendation for Christians
review/text: I discovered this book in a search for something new about the story of Jacob to enhance a short sermon. The book drew me into the world of 2500 years of Torah scholarship; into its great traditions of exposition, argument and story telling.The clear way in which Rabbi Kushner presents great thoughts of Torah scholars, his writing style, and love of their wisdom, allow the reader to "be" at once a yeshiva student and a friend worthy of intimate conversation. The chapter on De Leon - Rabbi Luria - which presents the 10 commandments as a circular system, offers unique insight.Rabbi Kushner's longing for the Messiah, which is so evident in his writing has added much to my understanding of my own faith.Rabbi Kushner's liberal use of story to explain on many levels that which is difficult to explain at all sheds a new light on the "parables" of JesusI eagerly seek out any word of a new book. It is a blessing that when other baby boomers were rejecting their faith and their heritage, Lawrence Kushner was embracing his, and doing all the hard work with the result that his readers are drawn to the Light. He is my most precious spiritual mentor.

review/summary: Too Much on the Mystical Plate
review/text: The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored.

The truth of the matter is we can continue to learn what a vast multitude of sages and scholars have to say about this quote from Genesis. One of the things which makes life interesting is just when you think you have given thought to every possible explanation, there are always those you haven't thought of, read, etc. What is even more amazing is that these diverse interpretations are all correct!Kushner is a wonderful author whose writings invite you in for a nice hot cup of tea, like an old friend, or member of the family.

review/text: A selection of short stories based on a science fiction theme. This book is highly recommened and it is a complete shame that it's out of print."The Giftie Gie Us" is about a post apocalyptic world where justice is won the hard way and love is even harder to find."The Dreamsender" is a story about a possible future where very special people can go into others dreams and send messages, or just talk to them. "Dreamsending" doesn't seem to have anything to do with time and space...meaning that a person can just as easily send messages across the galaxy as they can to their next door neighbor. So when a conspiracy happens on the moon and men seem to be kidnapped how do they get messages in and out of their prison?"The Energy Crisis of 2215" is about humanity needing more energy for the earth. They capture a black hole to fulfill this requirement. What they don't know is the black hole is unstable and sitting right next to the earth."Return to the Fold" is about a person that has been conditioned since birth to want to be away from other people. Not only can he not stand being in the same room as someone else, he can't stand being in a room someone else was in. This works well on space voyages lasting twenty or thirty years, but horrible when a person wants to be like everyone else. What is he to do?"The Shadows of Evening" is about humans colonizing another planet and an indigenous life form that doesn't like technology. This life form encircles anything technological and tries to get rid of any people around it. There is a special group of men that can get rid of these "shadows" and have been doing it for generations. When a new, easier way is found to rid the world of "shadows" these highly trained, highly respected Shadow Warriors are no longer needed. These men start to resent the newly trained Mindmasters."Not Always To The Strong" is the sequel to "The Shadows of Evening." In this story a rich man wants to control the newly made Mindmasters. To do this he gets the help of some of the best Shadow Warriors he can, including the main character in the last story."The Challenge" is about humanities obsession with video games and an alien race watching us from the outside."The Cassandra" is about humans that can see disasters and death in the future. Sometimes their predictions are right, usually they're not. Or so people assumed...."Dragon Pax" is about what happens to a planet after mankind has had a war that turned human civilization throughout the universe into chaos. On this planet there is a ruler called the Dragonmaster. This man has absolute power over gigantic dragons that can cause death and mayhem to anyone he desires. Does this man really want to have the kind of government he has for this country or will he make someone stand forward to help bring democracy to this world?"Job Inaction" is about a future Earth where people get jobs based on a lottery rather then work experience, or education. In this future world a man is fired because of a computer glitch and he must find a way to either get his job back or make money some other way."Teamwork" is about an alien spacecraft that lands on Earth and makes humans into slaves. A special group of people must go in and destroy the craft and save the humans aboard."The Final Report on the Lifeline Experiment" is about a psychic man that decides to find out when humans have human thought patterns. The consequences of his actions are unforeseen by him or anyone else until years in the future."Cascade Point" is about a space ship lost in time and space and what they have to do to get back to their Earth.

review/summary: Oscar Wilde: Theory on a Holiday
review/text: Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man under Socialism depicts the tangential and unintended callousness of socialistic thinking when it is merely theoretical and future-based and is not also activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde understands perfectly well that one of the principal goals of socialism is the elimination of poverty: "The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible." That might be the aim, but what should be done in the meantime to alleviate the suffering of the poor? In a word, the answer for Wilde is "nothing." He argues that charitable attempts to help the poor both fail to help the poor but also "prolong" the disease that cause poverty. The disease, of course, is the system of capitalistic exploitation. It is wrongheaded, Wilde argues, to use the fruits of capitalism to redress the consequences of its rampages: "It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair." While Wilde is confident that the ravages of poverty will cease in a future socialistic society, he opposes all palliatives for the poor and oppressed in the meantime. That is one of the consequences of confining socialistic thought to merely theoretical and future-based considerations and failing to also make it activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde's socialism of "voluntary association" of the future is individualistic (individuals should be free to choose their own work), anti-authoritarian, and government-less (largely anarchical). In fact, Wilde sees authoritarian socialism as constituting a worse state of affairs than capitalistic exploitation: "If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first."Wilde extols the prospects of an anti-authoritarian socialistic society because of its potential to actualize individuality. But Wilde's individualism has a kind of hierarchy about it--one, it is impossible to fail to notice, that leaves persons like himself at the top: "These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture--in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation." Apparently, those given to other vocations are not quite as "real" and can only partially realize these Olympian heights.Soon Wilde's discussion of individualism acts as an unstable catalyst, causing him to veer into a wide variety of topics often inexplicably. But the topics that preoccupy him for most of the work are aesthetic and literary concerns, especially as they relate to the relationship between individualism and artistic expression. While this discussion has some merit and interest, it is difficult to imagine why these peevish considerations require the lengthy treatment they receive in a work entitled "The Soul of Man under Socialism."My reservations about Wilde's work notwithstanding, I do think this is a relatively important work to read. While the work as a whole lacks a coherence that could have made it more effective, many individual passages are keenly insightful and highly quotable.

review/summary: Very interesting, but sad.
review/text: The Soul of Man under Socialism was a very interesting little book. Although, I don't believe Oscar Wilde's interests included the common Socialist schools. Yet, socialism was the fad of the day. Many intellectuals were interested in the theories, but Oscar was in his eyes an artist and an Individualist. Capital "I" on individualist.I couldn't find a date for this writing, but I believe his legal problems and the rumors preceding his legal problems were actually the motivation, and not economics or politics.As many artists and I consider myself one, believe their work and their life are one. Oscar showed his colors as far as common people go. I could not imagine him an equal to a chimney sweep or a waiter.Oscar was hurt and he was attempting to argue that life style, and art, especially his, should be free from the common people's rules. Poetry was not controlled because nobody read poetry.I find Oscar Wild a very human elitist and although I thought it sad, I enjoyed his work immensely and this work was no different.(PS: I really appreciate Kindle books. This book was free and I received it immediately. I own at least 100 kindle books.)

review/summary: An interesting little essay
review/text: Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile.

review/text: Ill try and type on my puny K three keyboard so bear with me here. This witing is about an ideal very popular in his time. Socialism has been incorporated into the US and other free world governments everywhere. Like any great concept it had to be blended with its polar opposite capitalism. This was most evident in the sixties and Nixons HMO programs of the seventies. Hey it gave birth to a compromise that led to a golden age of todays unprecidented easy lifestyles. Any person would be insane to want to go back in time and live their hardships. Think about it.....

review/text: We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling.

review/summary: Not a very good Little Critter book
review/text: I grew up with the Litter Critter books and they always have been some of my favorite children's books. I recently got this one for my son, and I don't care for this story much at all.First off, its about mom and dad going away on a trip. However they only address that issue once, and that's on the first page when mom and dad leave and it says that grandma and grandpa are watching them. They wave goodbye.Then all the rest of it is just Little Critter messing things up or having suggestions that aren't great (such as sucking up the curtain vacuuming, knocking over a vase dusting, spilling the paint, using too much toothpaste or dish soap, wanting to buy all junk food at the store, etc.)It really feels like this is so similliar or much more suited to the Little Critter I Just Forgot book or Little Critter Visiting Grandma and Grandpa. It has very little to do with getting your child ready to be away from mom and dad should they be going on a short trip so the book fails in what it appears to be trying to do based on the title. Most other Little Critter books do a great job of telling a story that covers some kind of kid issue or fear, this one just doesn't address the issue of the title and is dissapointing.

review/summary: Enjoyable Read
review/text: This was definitely worth reading! I became a fan of Christine Feehan only a few months ago and I hope she continues to write often as I have enjoyed all of her novels so far. This story was very enjoyable and interesting. I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters and also some of the secondary characters, especially the children. It was a little predicatable, but there is still a quality in Christine Feehan's writing that grabs you and keeps you interested... and wishing that it had not ended!The only compliants I have is that one of the brothers characters was undeveloped to the point that it did not make sense, as well as the &quot;special gifts&quot; that both the main characters had. The authors seemed to imply some power beyond ESP, but yet never expanded or provided any sort of explanation for these &quot;gifts&quot;.I am really looking forward to the next novel. I hope it will be a continuation (perhaps the Don's brother?) of this story. I am also still hoping for more vampire romances as well!

I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not. But be warned, by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan.

Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!

His home, the Palazzio, is a foreboding place, mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the &quot;pounce on each other in the first chapter&quot; genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts.

review/summary: Riveting
review/text: I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special &quot;gifts&quot; which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has &quot;gifts&quot; of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the &quot;I hate you!&quot; temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting.

review/text: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the &quot;dark&quot; series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!

review/text: I would have enjoyed it more if the hero had some other powers other then being able to read minds, which by the way he's not very good at it.Or he should have been able to read the minds of who was betraying him and trying to kill him & his new bride. When the plot seems to be in trouble with no way out he can read thoughts. And only when the heroine is distressed,or in trouble. Who only questions him about his ability after she's married to him. And she keeps getting into trouble because he won't tell her anything, just keeps patting her on the head and telling her not to worry, he will protect her. Which he also doesn't do to well. The plot is long and at times boring. I hope Ms. Feehan stays with her paranormal charactars.

I started to read it and in the first chapter it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day (of course I got no work done) but it was well worth it.

review/text: Once again Christine Feehan has written an interesting tale. Every book I have read is better than the prior one. The characters come alive and you feel as if you are there with them. I have read stories in all of her series and I can't decide which series is my favorite. They are all intriguing.

review/text: I just love Christine Feehans writing and this is just another to add to the growing list of favorites.The Scarletti Curse was an amazing book with a great story the main characters relationship was enjoyable and at times made me laugh. Nicoletta was a feisty and wonderfully defiant women with a sweet and loving nature and Don Scarletti was the dark mysterious and dangerous man with a bad rep however when the two come together it makes a brilliant piece of work and I JUST LOVED IT from the beginning. You can just picture it in your mind everytime the Don arches his eyebrow at Nicoletta because of something she has done.One word for this womans work . . . . AMAZING

review/summary: Christine Feeham has done it again!
review/text: This was a great book. I have read several of Christine's Dark series so I knew that this would be a page turner and it was. This one is a gothic historical romance. It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte, or in English palace of death, to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done. There are some very interesting secondary characters that I think would make good heros and heroines for possible future books. Get this book. You'll really enjoy it.

review/summary: Engaging page turner!
review/text: The Scarletti Curse is the story of a young and very innocent healer, Nicoletta, who is chosen to stand beside a powerful Don, the Don Scarletti, whom even the king feared. The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's, where the women they love end up dead, and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die, including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer), herself, is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath), and the story developed from there, with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night, the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot;, uncertain on what I would find. On one hand, she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her &quot;Dark&quot; series about the Carpathians. On the other, this was a non-Carpathian book, though a Gothic, so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here: Christine has hinted that Nicoletta and Giovanni have some relation to her Carpathian series. I look forward to her exploring that in more detail)I really hope that Christine explores Antonello's character. He was a secondary character and very mysterious, the only character that Christine did not explore in depth. He quite fascinated me. I would also like to see some explanation as to where Giovanni and Antonello got their telepathic abilities.Thank you, Christine! Keep up the great work, and I hope that the publisher will release a lot more books of your books A LOT faster, as I will buy every one.

review/summary: All of the elements I like in a romance
review/text: As a fan of gothic and paranormal stories, this book appealed to me. True, it had a lot more sex than Victoria Holt or other gothic writer favorites ever included in their books, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Nicolette is a free spirit with a secret. She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders. They know Nicolette could be burned as a witch, otherwise. Don Giovanni, the dark brooding aristocrat, wants Nicolette the first time he sees her. Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die, he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don't believe in giving too much information in a review so I won't say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings, the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives, and last but not least, the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant, but not overly so. He had a soft, gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance, at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince, another book I have by her.

review/summary: Excellent read!
review/text: I became a fan of Christine's writing through her &quot;Dark&quot; series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong, compassionate, courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti, who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the &quot;Palazzo Della Morte&quot; where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy, like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine, for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide!

review/summary: Another great read
review/text: Ms. Feehan has written another entertaining, and engrossing book. I got very little sleep the day I sat down to read Scarletti Curse, I didn't stop until I had read every page.Ms. Feehan's gothic bears her trademark paranormal touch. The hero, Don Giovanni Scarletti has telepathic abilities and the heroine, Nicoletta has healing abilities. While helping the Don's sick niece, Nicoletta catches the eye of the Giovanni, who decides that he wants her for his bride. Nicoletta is less than thrilled at that honor, since both her mother and aunt were killed under suspicious circumstances while employed at Palazzo Scarletti, a.k.a Palazzo della Morte (palace of death). Thus begins the tale of our fair hero and heroine. Will the Don be able to win Nicoletta`s heart? Should Nicoletta trust Giovanni? Will Nicoletta be the next victim of the Scarletti curse? What dark secret is the Scarletti family hiding? Strap up and get ready for one heck of ride as Nicoletta and Giovanni learn things that they never expected about themselves, and each other.Looking forward to reading more from this author.

review/summary: Wonderful gothic
review/text: Please keep in mind if you are an avid fan of Feehan, this is a different style of writing for her. I love her Dark Series and was even more impressed with her new Gothic novel. Our dark hero is made from the same mold that created her Dark Series men: powerful, dark, serious, passionate, and ofcourse possessive. We love these traits, that's why we keep coming back for more! She has created a wonderful book that includes drama, horror (as in strange things happening at the palace), and passion. I thought it was a stimulating, and thought-out plot with tense scenes that keeps you engrossed. The growing attraction and passion between the two main characters leaves you wanting to read it again. If you are fond of Gothic authors, Victoria Holt and Dorthy Eden, you will love this book. (Beware..it has alittle bit more romance and steamy scenes than our traditional authors.)

review/text: I've really like Christine Feehan Gothic stories, I have to admite that I had finish reading this book since June but haven't had the chance to write my review till now.This book is dark and mysterious which is filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with healing gift's .She embrace life with such open arms and feet ( you'll understand once you read it). Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery which makes you want to know him and his family even more. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.Christine Feehan has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit but I guess she wanted the readers to have a good visual through out the read.

review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful!
review/text: Having read Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series, I have to say that I think this is her best book ever. THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn't quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read.

review/summary: Brimming with mystery and . . . danger
review/text: I must confess that I was very leery to begin reading this book. My feelings have nothing to do with Ms. Feehan's writing style. I so love Christine's Dark series, I feared that I would inevitably begin to make comparisons and would find this book a major disappointment. It wasn't.There is a terrible curse which plagues the Scarletti men. Every woman who enters the Palazzo as a bride winds up dead. What or . . . whom is causing these fatal accidents?Nicoletta is a healer who possesses &quot;special&quot; gifts. Deep within her being she senses when someone needs her. She is drawn to the great Palazzo knowing that there is a young girl inside who is desperately ill. Once inside those forbidding walls, she encounters Don Giovanni Scarletti known as Il Demonico (The demon).He is dark, brooding and utterly dangerous. Nicoletta instinctively senses the potential threat he poses to her yet she is drawn to him as he is to her. Even the knowledge of his dark and deadly reputation cannot sever the attraction from growing.Don Scarletti also possesses his own &quot;gifts&quot; and chooses her for a bride. What initially begins as a duty for Nicoletta turns into passion than into love. Will Nicoletta suffer the same fate as others have? Or will her unwavering love and ulfaltering courage finally bring an end to the family's deadly curse?You have to read the book in order to find out those answers and more. Enjoy!

review/summary: Has enough mystery to keep you reading
review/text: For many years, the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil, murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo, and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death), it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers, the current don has set his eyes on their healer, Nicoletta, the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine, with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue, and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial, but when I'm reading a historical novel, I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall, this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant, Antonietta Scarletti, in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment).

review/text: This was a great book! But the dialogue between Nicoletta and her guardian just seem to drag on forever! I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that, the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers.

review/text: I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, "leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier.

review/text: I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.

review/text: At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to. It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti, she sensed something evil about him and his family. Don Scarletti had possession of her mind, body, and soul. His dark features were erotic, yet frightening to Nicoletta. However, I have found myself getting a little bored with the book. It seems as if something that is bound to happen, doesn't happen. It's a good read, but unfortunately I am getting restless and impatient with the Scarletti curse and the passionate fires between Nicoletta and Don Giovanni.

review/summary: The Scarletti Curse
review/text: This is another of Christine Feehan brilliant books. She can make you part of that, that is written. You start reading and you can't put it down, I know I couldn't. If you enjoy books of physical,telpathic and romance you will love this. Every time I read one of her books they just get better.

review/summary: Beautiful & Touching
review/text: I really love The Scarletti Curse, having reread it for more than 5 times I believe.The pacing is good, with enough action, excitement and unconditional love (a necessity to destroy the evil curse at work).The book starts with village girl Nicoletta being summoned to accompany the village "healer" Maria Pia, who raised Nicoletta since her mother's death, to the Scarletti Palazzo. They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book "Dark Symphony, in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia, suffering from food poisoning. While both "healer" and assistant do their work, Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta, asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says "I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think"!A few days later the "healer" and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again, but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant, but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta, who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up, a few murders commited, the staff gossip, while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo.

review/summary: Excellent Gothic romance
review/text: What an excellent book. Great use of characters and character growth. The chracters are revealed slowly in layers. Multidimensional supporting characters. There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.

review/summary: It was OK
review/text: This book was a bit different for me perhaps because of its historical setting. It started out well, but i soon tired of the Italien phrases, such as &quot;mia madre&quot; and &quot;mia zia&quot; That got really annoying. Also, the Hero was very violent and cagey at first then suddenly got tender and mushy towards the end. It was disconcerting. Ms. Feehan seems to have a preference for characters with dark hair and eyes. I need a little more variety, please! Ms. Feehan also writes her main female characters to fight desperately for their independence throughtout the book, knowing that they will not end against their brooding, possessive Hero. I get tired of the constant whining and carrying on. But it seems that the females also go through some magical personality transformation after the first sex scene. I know sex is good, but come on. Overall, I liked the story even it did bog down in a few places, and i hated the main female's name, Nicoletta. reminds of all those stop-cigarette-smoking commercials.

review/summary: A slow start but an exciting climax
review/text: I started this book with great expectations after reading all the dark series but found it not as compelling as them to start with. It took me a while to get into the book. The story is slow to start with, but it develops into a very exciting climax. I never guessed the culprit and it was a complete surprise to me. I think I have been spoiled for anything else by the Dark Series and it will take a lot to compete with them. I would have given this book 5 stars if it hadn't been for the beginning.

review/summary: Sure Miss
review/text: I have loved all of Christine Feehans &quot;Dark&quot; novels. I was looking forward to the Scarleti novel as well. I was suprised at her change of writting style. I kept thinking I was reading a Ann Rice wanta be. The characters are now well drawn, Nicolette is weak, scared and is not consitant with her personality. We do not get to know what makes Giovanni &quot;tick&quot; he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanni,who is cursed, after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her, even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat, to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead, not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves, or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family &quot;curse&quot; for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse. I do not recommend the book, it was a disappointment to me. The writter spent to much time using words to describe the landscape and the buildings and the rooms and I don't remember what all else, and she did not develope her characters.

review/summary: Feehan never misses
review/text: If you're a fan of Christine Feehan, you already know some of the elements you'll find in this book - beautiful, courageous, spirited heroine and strong, intelligent, handsome, tortured hero. Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting, sensuous, just flat out stunning way. This book, though not about the vampire-like beings in her others, adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing, and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting, and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited, naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing.

review/text: I loved Nicoletta and her gift of healing. And I loved Giovanni and his gift of reading minds and feeling other people's feeling and speaking directly into her head. And there was a lot of mystery in this book. At times it was really scary, especially when the bird came and I had the feeling that something terrible is going to happen... again. The connection and chemistry between the main characters was amazing, but I would love to see at least a part of the story from the hero's point of view. This really was an interesting, complex and satisfying read :)

Great romance, intriguing hero, very compelling heroine, etc. I will definitely search for this author's Dark series books next. If you love gothic, you'll really enjoy this book. And I really enjoyed the italien phrases Zia, Zio, Mia, pallazzo etc. it enriched the story. Faraway time and place, foggy towering castle filled with eerie gargoyles and scary sculptures, dark cliffs, raging seas, mazes, puzzles, hidden passageways, maps, the bridal covenant.... Gosh what more could you want?!

review/text: The book was good up until the end, when I found out who the killer was. I was expecting more. Towards the end of the book finding the real killer killed it for me. To me towards the end the story started loosing itself. I guess the way the ending was written, letting one know who the killer is, was not done properly. One is kept in suspense through out the whole story, and then she just trows you who the killer is out of nowhere and in a rush. Her best work is the Dark series books. I cannot wait for DARK DESIRE.

review/summary: Scarletti Curse
review/text: I enjoy Ms Feehan's general writing style, and loved every one of the Dark Series books...but this gothic started very slow. For over a hundred pages, I still felt like the background was still being set and the real story hadn't begun. Finally, she gets to the gothic mansion and I felt that THAT is when the story began. Once at this point, the plot seems to take up some speed and has a lot of suspense and gothic darkness. Although some questions are answered, I felt like she could have taken some of the characters a bit further. I also felt like some of the scenes were startlingly switched, for the suspense, and I had to go back and re-read a page again to figure out what was going on. I wouldn't re-read this again, but would still probably want to try her next gothic to see how that one goes.

review/text: Wonderful book! Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!

review/summary: Fabulous Book! Fabulous Author!!
review/text: I'm not usually a gothic fan, but I LOVE Christine Feehan's books, so I grabbed this one and took a chance(I did the same back when I picked up Ms. Feehan's first &quot;Dark&quot; book, never having been a vampire fan,and those books have become my all-time favorite Keepers). Once again this incredible author did not dissapoint. I was riveted from page one! This is an author that not only yanks you into the story with a fascinating plot and incredibly descriptive detail (I actually got chills and the hair on my arms raised while I walked through the Palazzo with Nicolletta), but her characters become a part of you. Her characters are so real I truly found myself loving them. Not just finding them interesting, amusing, wonderful and touching, but really caring about them, as though they were actual people, a part of my life. Ms. Feehan weaves such a powerful spell sometimes I have to remind myself it's not real. Her books are THAT GOOD!!!The only drawback, of course, is the usual one, waiting impatiently for this author's next book to come out! I highly recomend The Scarletti Curse, as well as ALL of Christine Feehan's previous books. YOU ARE IN FOR A REAL TREAT!

review/text: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame.

He wanted her from the moment he saw her, despite her efforts to disguise her beauty. She went to his house to treat his niece who was poisoned and she ends up treating him as well since he too was poisoned. Problem with wanting to marry her is, all the women his family has chosen for their brides ends up dead. But he is not going to let that stop him from getting Nicoletta. Their story was beautiful and romantic and was a great pleasure to read. This book had just the right balance of mystery, horror and passion. Highly recommend.

review/text: I have read almost all of Ms. Feehan's books, but I think this has become one of my favorites. I was kind of hesitant to buy it because it wasn't part of the Dark Series, and I wasn't sure I'd like it. Once I saw the price though, I decided to take a chance. After reading the first chapter, I knew my worries were TOTALLY unfounded. I was hooked! And to my surprise, the story is about an ancestor of Antonietta Scarletti (the female lead of "Dark Symphony"). I could NOT put it down!

review/text: What a read! I loved it. The romance was hot but it wasnt just that. Feehan creates a world that you believe and all the characters are well written. There was no author intrusion in any of the pages and the curse plot works really well as it turns out to be something you dont expect at all. All Feehan lovers will enjoy this as its Feehan at her best. Dont be sad that there arent any Carthapians in it, the story really doesnt need any!

review/summary: Excellent Non-Carpathian Novel
review/text: While I am not usually a fan of books where the hero is overly domineering, I must concede that Christine Feehan writes so well that I enjoy her novels even though the men are so controlling and obsessive it would be frightening in real life.&quot;The Scarletti Curse&quot; is not a part of the Carpathian series, but I found myself enjoying it as much, if not more. The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself, she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately, the one man she wishes to hide this talent from, Giovanni Scarletti, is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work, the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine, it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with &quot;Lair of the Lion.&quot; This novel is much, much better. If you like her Carpathian series, or are interested in paranormal romance, this is a good book to read.

review/summary: Exciting gothic story line
review/text: No female, whether they are of the blood or through marriage, survives THE SCARLETTI CURSE. They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still, she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However, the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass, suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies, but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale, this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her "Dark" series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner

review/summary: Gothic danger and passionate love -- Very highly recommended
review/text: The ancient dons worshipped the old gods, honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed, and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed, the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta, a woman who is known to be &quot;different&quot; in her gifts to heal, to listen to the wind, to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride, Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her, but when she fled her home to hide, the don followed her, luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice, erotic and seductive, entices her imagination and her womanhood, linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife, as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work, I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions, and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style, a deep understanding for history, and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism, THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning, including the dark castle with gargoyles, warnings from natural elements, portents from ravens, secret passageways, family secrets, and multiple dead wives. Further, the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings, while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow. Very highly recommended.

But a still more fearful secret lurked within its storm-tossed turrets. For every bride who entered its forbidding walls was doomed to leave in a casket.Mystical and unfettered, Nicoletta had no terror of ancient curses and no fear of marriage...until she looked into the dark, mesmerizing eyes of Don Scarletti. She had sworn no man would command her, had thought her gift of healing set her apart, but his was the right to choose a bride from among his people. And he had chosen her.Compelled by duty, drawn by desire, she gave her body into his keeping, and prayed the powerful, tormented Don would be her heart's destiny, and not her soul's demise.

review/summary: OK BOOK - BUT ANNOYING WRITING STYLE
review/text: The Premise for this book follows the old gothic format. Heroine goes into spooky house - falls for tortured hero - danger lurks around every corner. I used to love this type of romance, but this one was extremely annoying! The plot was good, the hero and heroine were a good match, but I could not get past all the breaks in the sentences to inclue a couple of Italian words. It seemed that Ms. Feehan tried too hard to add that touch of Italian to every other sentence by putting in the two Italian words for my bother, my mother, my father, my grandfather, my grandmother. It was down right annoying to keep reading these few sets of words so frequently. It was very hard to keep the pace of reading the book when the sentences were broken up so often with the Italian. I have been a romance reading for over 20 years and have frequetnly read romance with touches of another language thrown in here and there, but this one was just to choppy for me to enjoy. I don't think I'll be inclined to buy another Feehan gothic unless I get the chance to skim it first. I will however keep reading her Dark series which I absolutely love.

Like the men in her other series the hero is laboring under a dark shadow and needs that special one woman to make his life light. He is over protective and dictatorial and the woman can't help but want him. The fact that the curse was healed with a little pop psychology did not help the book either. It is still a pleasurable read but it is not one I wanted to repeat.

review/text: I am realtively new to Christine Feehan, and have really enjoyed all of her &quot;Dark&quot; series. This was the first gothic novel I've read in quite some time. I must say that while the book was diverting, it was not one of my favorites by Feehan. I didn't find Nicoletta to be all that sympathetic. There were also a lot of minor characters with many names that the reader has to keep straight.Also, while Nicoletta's supernatural powers were explained pretty well, one never really gets to understand why Giovanni has them, or where they come from.But, all of that being said, it was creepy and certainly kept me reading. I was still thinking about the book this morning as I woke up, so that's something. While I wouldn't recommend this book as being one of her best, it is certainly an entertaining read.

Despite the large over-all map and the smaller maps that occasionally popped up, I would still have appreciated more detailed maps of what was being described in the text. Smaller maps of exactly where to walk at each site described would add make it easier to visualize, as one reads the book. Also, I would have appreciated more of an effort to highlight what one must see with limited time, what to see with somewhat more time, etc. One is left with a dizzying list of sites with not enough assitance in prioritizing them.

Even if it is called Using Bar Codes in Distribution, it is as relevant for other applications.There are a some redundancies in this book that would need to be fixed in a reeddition. Also it would be nice if a reedition was done since it dates from 2000 and technology has evolved so much. But still, even without these improvements it is a great book.

review/summary: A Standard Work From Which To Start
review/text: I am a Seminary instructor teaching a course called Principles of Biblical Interpretation. Obviously this book is part of the required reading. It is a 'standard' work by which I mean that it and a few others are considered to be baseline, required reading for anyone who wishes to advance beyond the elementary level in the field of hermeneutics.That said, I give it four stars because it is definitely not accessible by everyone. It is written for people who have a serious goal in mind and a disciplined study habit. It is not "easy reading" though it is well worth the effort. Further it is much more beneficial to those who have at least a working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew & Greek. In my class there are those who are entry level students (or auditors) who do not meet these criteria and I require them to read Berkhof but I augment the course with other books ("Reading the Bible With Heart & Mind" by T. Longman, for one). This helps them advance with what they can get from Berkhof and reminds the more advanced students of their need to remain devotional in their Bible studies also.All in all, highly recommended for any reader as long as they understand what they are getting. You will be introduced to the various historical approaches to Biblical Interpretation (there are more than one you know), a sketch of a critique for each and a solid outline of how to build a more carefully crafted understanding of what the Bible teaches in your own reading.

review/summary: Good summary of most important features
review/text: I'm currently doing a course entitled "Introduction to Biblical Interpretation". This is one of the books I've read to help me come to terms with the material.This book appears to be based on a set of lecture notes prepared by Berhof for his students, more than having been written as a book from the beginning.I found its treatment of the various topics related to Biblical interpreation easy to follow, but covered in less depth than most other books. That said, I think what is said here would be sufficient for many people to come to terms with the core principles.At the end of many of the sections in the book are a list of references to other books and a set of questions. The questions seem to be based on the other works referenced, but I haven't been able to check as I don't have access to any of the cited works. Unfortunatly, due to the age of this text, many of the cited works are not longer in print.Many of the questions later on in the book are require you to apply the techniques covered to particular verses; no answers are provided, so it'd be useful for you to have someone who you can ask to check your answers.

review/summary: Plenty of Twists and Turns
review/text: First off, let me say that although all of Cornwell's thrillers stand alone, it's better if you read them in the order they were written. More so in PC's case than in other authors who continue with the same character, book after book. This is because PC does the impossible, she keeps her characters continually growing with each story. Pass one up and you miss some of their development and the very interesting, but very flawed people that walk through the pages of her books are like people we know, friends, and one should stay current with one's friends."Cruel and Unusual" opens with Kay waiting for the execution of murder/rapist Ronnie Joe Waddell, but even as she's waiting someone is being killed, the killer using Waddell's M.O. One of his finger prints even shows up at one of the crime scenes.This book has the usual Cornwellian twists and turns and as usual I was glued to my seat as I read this five star novel. I loved every second of it, because nobody does Cornwell, like Cornwell.

review/summary: Woah- what happened between All That Remains and Cruel & Unusual?? Too many plot holes
review/text: Who is Dr. Kay Scarpetta? Let her tell you:"I was a physician with a law degree. I had been trained to know what gave life and what took it, what was right and what was wrong. Then experience had become my mentor, wiping its feet on that pristine part of myself that was idealistic and analytical. It is disheartening when a thinking person is forced to admit that many cliches are true. There is no justice on this earth. Nothing would ever undo what Ronnie Joe Waddell had done." (p. 6)Scarpetta is a the medical examiner and Waddell, recently executed inmate, is her latest case. The Waddell case won't be so easy, and it turns out his prints are showing up at crimes during and after his execution. Was the wrong person executed? Waddell's prints are in "the system". Speaking of systems, who broke into Scarpetta's computer? And why are her two employees, Ben and Susan, acting strangely? On top of this, Scarpetta has to "babysit" her sidekick and her niece. Her sidekick, Pete Marino, is a cop who can't get over the end of his marriage. With bad health habits and a sour disposition, Scarpetta has to constantly remind Marino to watch out for himself. And her niece, Lucy, has gone from being a fat little kid to a thin, super intelligent math and science whiz. Lucy is now a bratty 17- year old with a terrible attitude. But hey, she can help Scarpetta with the computer, so it's worth having Lucy around! (I think Lucy is supposed to be annoying- it makes her more realistic.)So, it appears Scarpetta has to figure out why Waddell's prints are appearing at new crimes and why other people are being murdered. Simple enough, right? Yes, but it doesn't stay simple. Cornwell makes the plot extremely hole-ridden with little sidetracks. Scarpetta's missing her lover, Mark James. She's trying to make amends with flakey morgue attendant Susan Story. Professionally, Scarpetta's in A LOT of trouble, and the government nor the media will give her space. She also has to deal with the families of the deceased, who move in and out of the story, sometimes reappearing, and sometimes disappearing into thin air. These details bog down what could be an excellent thriller.What I do like - the vivid descriptions of Virginia winters. Completely spot on, and it makes me look forward to a break in my current sticky, summer weather. :)The medical procedures are described in detail - electric chair executions, autopsies, fatal gun shot wounds, etc.Again, though, Cornwell does "too much of a good thing" by getting overly technical with the description of Robyn Naismith's/Sam Potter's residence. As for the mysterious feathers, again, too much detail is given to the what, where, why and how's of orinthology. Too many pages devoted to the types of feathers in down. Bo-ring!This is an average read. I am not encouraging you to run to your local bookstore, because it would be a total waste of money. When you have time, and space on your library card account, check out this book. BUT, do not make it your first Scarpetta novel, because it will turn you away from the series!

review/summary: Excellent first half, unfocussed and over-the-top second half
review/text: 'Cruel And Unusual' won Patricia Cornwell the CWA's Gold Dagger award, suggesting that those in the know regard it as her best Scarpetta book. I'm not so sure. The first half is excellent, raising the baffling and unsettling prospect of a killer committing murders from Beyond The Grave. But I feel the book badly loses focus in the second half, resulting in a rushed and somewhat anti-climactic conclusion.Note that this book sets up a story thread through the next two books, so you must read this before tackling 'The Body Farm' and 'From Potters Field'.To the story itself: convicted murderer Ronnie Waddell has just been executed. But when a young boy is found murdered in a strikingly similar fashion, Scarpetta, Marino and Wesley are forced to consider a number of disturbing possibilites. Is there a copycat killer? Or was the wrong man sentenced to the chair? This part of the book is well written, with a strong focus on the forensic science, as well as a study of Waddell himself and the crime he allegedly committed. But when another "copycat" killing turns up Waddell's fingerprint, things take a very bizzare twist.Here is where the book loses me. Instead of considering more logical possibilities about how a dead man's fingerprint might have got somewhere, Scarpetta and Co jump to the most extraordinary conclusion. The idea that Waddell could (a) convince another person to go to the chair for him, and (b) organise smuggling the imposter in and himself out, is ridiculous. Also, the latter part of the book is increasingly taken up with an investigation into Scarpetta herself, dragging her into court on the flimsiest of "evidence". Cornwell really lets her poor-woman-persecuted-by-evil-sexist-men theme go over the top here. Arrogant oaf Patterson may be, but to pin a multiple murder on Scarpetta? It's silly.The end result is that the conclusion to the book is incredibly rushed. It literally takes place within the last few pages, and is based on little more than a sudden hunch from Scarpetta. Combined with the fact that the finale is deliberately open-ended, the whole thing comes across as a huge anti-climax. While it does provide the perfect lead-in to 'The Body Farm', as a stand-alone ending I can only remember how cheated I felt when I first read the book.So in all, a great beginning that's let down by a confused and unfocussed conclusion. The central plot is clever and the investigation is interesting, but it's disappointing Cornwell seems to lose the thread of the story badly in the second half.[3.5 stars].

The framing involves alleging that she is tampering with the autopsy results of Ronnie Waddell, an executed murderer. Meanwhile, murders are occurring that carry Waddell's M.O. How could he have committed these murders if he's been electrocuted? However, his fingerprints turn up at the crime scenes.This book is well-written and conceived as well as fun to read.

review/summary: Great story, great heroine
review/text: Somehow as I became initiated into the world of Kay Scarpetta I missed this gem. It was great to backtrack and discover what has become one of my favorite books in the series. The story is SO imaginative and original! The suspense is taut and kept me on the edge of my seat. And most of all, there is Kay, a three dimensional, refreshingly human heroine. No, she isn't perfect. As the possibility of an affair with a married man arose, I wasn't &quot;appalled&quot; by Kay, I was heartbroken for her. Driven by work, shattered by lost love, reaching for someone to bring her back to life emotionally ... her feelings may not be noble but they certainly seemed human to me. A powerful woman in a controversial, conventionally male field, and reviewers ask why so many people hate her? It seems very realistic that the head of a high-profile state agency would find herself with enemies. While I have no real criticism of this book, I do have a comment on the rest of the series. Part of why I enjoyed this one so much is Lucy. As the series progresses, Lucy's life gets so complicated and convulated and dangerous that it is her character, not Kay's, that strains credibility. It was refreshing to revisit a time when Lucy was a teenager whose biggest (immediate) problem was access to a car.

review/text: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.

review/summary: Semi-Gory Crime Novel with Daring Lack of Love Interest
review/text: This novel has both a good plot and some decent characterisation. It's gory, but not too gory, and the twists and the turns in the plot make it difficult to put down. In addition, the fact that there is no love interest makes it refreshingly different (the 'no' in 'no love interest' will be somewhat qualified by a reading of the novel), and the centrality of an aunt-niece relationship sub-plot just adds to the value, in my opinion.If you like crime fiction, and if a novel with a coroner as the main character/narrator would appeal to you - try this book.

review/text: The book is well written. However, the storyline has begun to be repititious, in that Kay is attacked in every book either by the criminal, or worse, her colleagues, over and over again. How much would one person stand for in the same job? And the major changes that happened between books was too much for me. Mark's dead? Lucy's grown? Kay's quit smoking? Kay's moved? Very choppy and alot to adjust too. Where is Abby?If Kay is so likeable, how is it she had so many enemies? THis is where I get off the series. THe lack of information about the main character, and the redundance is dissappointing. Also, I read that in the future books, Kay and Benton get together. Adultery? Appalling. Our beloved heroine can't even get her own man? Come on.

review/summary: solid Scarpetta police procedural
review/text: Henrico County, Virginia Detective Joe Trent calls the state Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta because of a situation involving thirteen year old Eddie Heath shot in the head with potential sexual components involved. At the same time the Commonwealth executes Ronnie Joe Waddell convicted of the murder of anchorwoman Robyn Naismith ten years earlier on evidence founded by Scarpetta.Scarpetta's autopsy of Heath uncovers the fingerprint of Waddell on the corpse. As anti capital punishment lawyer Grueman turns up the heat with the media claiming Scarpetta is incompetent, files are stolen from her office. More murders that apparently were committed by a dead Waddell lead Grueman orchestrating the press even further that perhaps the smoking gun of capital punishment has occurred, an innocent person executed. Other evidence against Scarpetta leads to a grand jury investigation into the possible criminal activities of the medical examiner.CRUEL AND UNUSUAL is a solid Scarpetta police procedural in which the beleaguered heroine is struggling to understand how a dead man could be murdering people and what happened to her once thriving career. The story line is filled with twists and turns that makes sense afterward but will surprise the reader while the grand jury inquiry is insightful and a bit shocking for instance the "defense" cannot bring in witnesses. Patricia Cornwell provides a strong Scarpetta thriller with the star in jeopardy of more than just her livelihood going down the tubes.Harriet Klausner

review/text: I chose the Scarpetta series on audio books to ease the tedium of a long commute, and now I find myself looking forward to getting in the car in the morning! In this installment we are introduced to an antagonist who will be given more flesh and color over the next couple of books, as all of the characters continue to grow and develop in Cornwell's work from book to book. Cruel & Unusual draws you in, gets you worried about the good doctor, teaches you a few things (if you pay attention), but this one doesn't have the usual ending! I won't give it away. Read it, it's worth the time.

review/summary: Really 3.5 stars...she has written better
review/text: Although Ms. Cornwell is not my favorite forensic murder mystery author, I almost always find her stories entertaining and her books serve the necessary purpose of my being antisocial on the subway to and from work. Cruel and Unusual, however, was not her best piece by a longshot, but seemed to be more of a 'filler' segment in the ongoing saga of Kay Scarpetta, medical examiner extraordinaire. As a scientist and hopefully a doctor in the future, I find the tone of the author to be condescending to the average reader's knowledge of science and forensics in general, however. I think enough Discovery Channel crime shows would cover the same material she describes over and over again. In any case, it was an entertaining thriller, but I enjoyed Point of Origin and Black Notice more.

review/text: A well written, detailed and nail-biting novel.But, the ending was anti-climatic and rather tepid.

If you like P.D. James, you may like her too, though I find the characters in P.D. James' novels psychologically more complex than Kay.

review/text: I listened to the audio version of &quot;Cruel &amp; Unusual&quot; on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the &quot;who&quot; of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, &quot;great book, bad ending...&quot; and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?

review/summary: One to Keep You Wondering...
review/text: CRUEL AND UNUSUAL is another Kay Scarpetta story line that makes one really think about the death penalty and if innocent people are ever executed.In CRUEL AND UNUSUAL, Scarpetta investigates the homicide of a young boy, Eddie Heath, in which evidence resembles that of a case from the past - a case in which the convicted murderer, Ronnie Joe Waddell, is put to death that night. Very strange occurrences continue to happen, including the fingerprint of Waddell showing up in the next murder victim's home and a morgue supervisor being killed by the same gun that killed Eddie Heath. The confusion that envelops Kay Scarpetta adds to the drama of this book, as she wonders if the wrong man was executed. Could it be a simple case of mistaken identity? You can bet that nothing is simple when Patricia Cornwell is creating the story line and developing it!Just when the reader thinks he/she has figured everything out, Patricia Cornwell adds another dip in the road and makes you rethink the entire list of events. Cornwell keeps you guessing until the end, and does so with a flare that is unique and thrilling. It's interesting to see just how many questions about a crime that Scarpetta can answer (and you can keep up with) without overloading the reader's brain. Cornwell seems to have that fine line gauged properly, as she never over-burdens the reader but instead keeps them entertained and intrigued until the last page. This is one tale that will keep you thinking even past that last page and wonder, what if...

review/summary: Interesting book to read during the holidays!
review/text: This is only the second of the author's &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot; novels that I've read, and I wasn't all that impressed with _Postmortem,_ so I approached this fourth book in the series with some scepticism, even though It seems to be one of the best reviewed. After a decade of appeals, Ronnie Joe Waddell is finally being executed and Scarpetta waits to perform the autopsy (though I'm not clear why that should be necessary). But that same evening, a young boy is ritually murdered in a manner very reminiscent of Waddell's style. That's followed by another murder -- and Waddell's fingerprints apparently are found on the scene. Was someone else executed in his place? The authorities involved, of course, don't even want to *think* about such an appalling possibility. More murders follow, including Scarpetta's own Morgue Attendant, and suddenly links seem to be turning up to tie the Chief Medical Examiner to the killings, as well as to corruption in her own office. All the action takes place in the few weeks preceding and following the Christmas-New Year's holidays, and the gray, cold winter adds greatly to the flavor of the narration.There's no question that this one is an improvement over the first one I read. Cornwell doesn't bring in a completely new character in the last chapter to be the villain, for one thing. And she has added considerable depth to the personalities of all the repeating characters, especially Lt. Pete Marino of Richmond Homicide and FBI Special Agent Benton Wesley. My favorite, though, is Lucy, Scarpetta's niece from Miami, who possesses what another character calls a &quot;frightening intellect.&quot; But she's still seventeen years old, and her home life is, in many ways, not a happy one. Aunt Kay really does try to be the friend and confident to Lucy that she would like to be, but she has her own emotional problems -- not least among them the death of her lover in an IRA bombing in London less than a year before -- and her naturally reserved and somewhat stony personality is sometimes her own worst liability.There are problems, though. Cornwell has a rather pompous style, especially when she's describing the latest crime-fighting technological advances, or the ins and outs of UNIX. It's as if she enjoys saying &quot;I know more about this than you do.&quot; She also indulges in irritating word-choices, such as not knowing the difference between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; (e.g., &quot;I put my revolver inside my purse&quot;), and she seems to be unaware of the use of contractions in ordinary speech. Still, the well thought out plot and the complications in possible motives and interpretations kept me reading. Many fans and reviewers take it as a given that Cornwell is the &quot;best&quot; mystery writer working, which I can't agree with at all. But she's not bad.

review/summary: Good read but a little too technical for mere mortal!
review/text: I quite enjoyed this book and found myself mystified throughout as to "whodunnit". In that sense it was a really good read and delivered the suspense it promised. I usually enjoy Patricia's books and like the way she builds a profile of her heroine's life, including the people she is close to as well as those more on the periphery of her life - it helps the reader to relate to her and treat her as a real person. I particularly like the way she combines her professional life with her personal one and think it shows the human side which is very necessary considering her profession which could otherwise seem very detached and clinical so well done for that consideration. The plot was complex but not too much so and very cleverly thought out. The only reason I didn't find it unputdownable was because for me the over usage of technical jargon got in the way too much. Most people not familiar with the terminology will probably find it irritating - after all, who wants to have to refer to a medical directory to understand what's being said! I have heard many others make a similar comment but personally I never found it a bother in her other books but on this occasion I was quite exasperated. A small quibble and I wouldn't let it put me off.

review/summary: Dissatisfying
review/text: Ronnie Joe Waddell, who's been on death row for nearly a decade for a vicious murder, is executed, and Kay Scarpetta is called on to perform an autopsy on his body. At least, she thinks it's his body. On the same day of Waddell's execution, another murder occurs--this one eerily similar to the one committed nine years ago. When the killer strikes again--this time, murdering one of Scarpetta's morgue assistants--Scarpetta quickly finds herself accused of committing the crime herself. Is it a copycat killer? Or has Waddell escaped his punishment? The plot is complex, and this works both for and against the book. The story sometimes so bizarre, so complex, that the reader can't help but keep turning the pages. On the other hand, the plot is so convoluted that the reader may lose track of what's going on. Although readers may agree that everything fits together in the end, they may still be feeling a little confused. In addition to this, Cornwell throws several plot elements at the reader that take the reader completely by surprise--and not in a good way. For example, Scarpetta is in the middle of the investigation when she suddenly recalls that a significant love interest has been killed in a terrorist attack several months before the story actually begins. This is certainly news to any reader who has read this book's predecessor, All That Remains, which concludes with the love interest still very much alive. So much is happening between the books that it just doesn't seem fair to the reader, not to mention sloppiness on the author's part. Cornwell would have done better to give the love story subplot more attention in the story, since it later plays a vital role in Scarpetta's exoneration. Overall, Cruel and Unusual works as a crime novel, but still leaves the reader somewhat dissatisfied at the end.

review/summary: A really bad book
review/text: Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no "grab" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, "I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book."Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel

review/summary: A lot can happen in a year.....
review/text: Mark's dead?!!?? Since he was Kay's lost/found love, I guess I would have expected more than a two paragraph explanation of what happened. I assume Kay will have a new love interest in a future book - let's just hope he fairs better than Mark did.Why did Kay move? How did she quit smoking (being an ex-smoker myself - I would be interested in reading the withdrawal symptoms of a medical examiner)? Any reconciliation attempts between Marino and his wife?How can so many people hack into Kay's files? Is it usual in an ME's position to have so many people against/after you (I don't recall Quincy having this much trouble)?The story line was good. The medical portions are morbidly interesting (that is a good thing). I miss the human element. Kay gave the reader more reaction with Abby's death from the previous novel than with the death of a man (Mark) that she has loved/hated for most of her adult life.

review/summary: A Mystery Worth Investigating
review/text: Kay Scarpetta is Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth of Virginia. As such she has the nasty job of processing the remains of murderer Ronnie Waddell, electrocuted after ten years of incarceration. The next day she has another body on her hands, a young man, Eddie Heath, dumped in the street strangely mutiliated. The modus operandi of Heath's murder has some suggestive echoes of the killing for which Waddell is executed. And the plot thickens further when a middle-aged fortune-teller turns up dead in her car and a fingerprint found on her furniture is identified as one of Waddell's. Meanwhile all is not well is Dr Scarpetta's office. Someone has been mucking about with the files on her computer and her morgue supervisor, Susan Stevens, is acting very oddly...This is rather good fun, extremely readable stuff. It's the first of Cornwell's books I have read and it leaves me feeling pretty well-disposed to the prospect of reading one or two more. Scarpetta is an interesting heroine, likeable but complicated and Cornwell is an excellent plotter. If you like crime fiction and haven't tried any Cornwell before, you could do a lot worse than checking this out.

review/summary: This is a great addition to the Scarpetta series
review/text: I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books and have enjoyed most of them quite a bit. Cruel and Unusual is one of the best in the series in my opinion. I say this because Cornwell is at her best when she quietly piles on the tension factor. Cornwell at her worst is when she feels the need to multiply the body count via the worlds evilest serial killer ala James Patterson. Sadly, after 'Cruel and Unusual', Cornwell starts in on several books that just go further and further out on a limb of insanity. Happily for you the reader, if you have not read this book yet, you are in for a very entertaining yarn from Cornwells best period.The plot here is fairly complicated and its hard to describe much of it without giving away some of the earlier surprises. So I will suffice to say that it starts out when Scarpetta is called in to do an autopsy on a recently executed death row inmate. However, it quickly becomes apparent that something is not quite right. A couple of days earlier a young lad had been killed in much the same manner as the death row inmate and soon it looks like the executed man somehow might not have been the right person put to death. Instead the death row guy might be out on the street knocking off victims once again. How did this happen?Also, Scarpetta is dragged into a series of questions to answer when files start to go missing in her office and something or other is amuck.I hope you read this book. If you haven't tried Scrapetta in the past, its best to start with the first in this series, Postmordom.

review/summary: Unexplained murders
review/text: Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta is involved with the autopsy of an executed man just as a young boy is killed in a grisly murder. Scarpetta realizes that the murder scene has a lot in common with the one which was created by the executed man 10 years ago. A third event is the murder of a person within Kay's own department. The husband of the murdered woman begins spreading damaging rumors about Scarpetta and a noose of circumstantial evidence is pulled around her. Soon she is trying to solve the murders for her own self-defense as well as just doing her job. During all of this, her young niece Lucy comes to stay with her and she helps with unraveling a mystery involving computer records of fingerprints. Scarpetta is also helped by her friends Pete Marino, a homicide investigator and Benton, an old friend from the FBI. This book has plenty of twists and turns and it will keep Scarpetta fans busily trying to figure out the solution.

This is the first book to feature Temple Gault so should read this before you read Body Farm & From Potter's Field.This book is a fast paced & should keep you flipping pages.The ending was a bit of a disappointment - loose ends not resolved. However, I did like this book & it was nice that there is no love interest.

Ms. Cornwell does a masterful job of weaving the story, adding twists, and providing enough technical detail to make it all believable. And then, just when she has you all set up for a masterful finish..it doesn't happen. It almost seems that this rushed ending was written by another person. It is a good read...that could have been a great read.

review/text: My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite.

review/summary: Forensically beautiful, yet disappointing,
review/text: The characters are so wooden and there is so much innuendo as to whose relationship is with or to whom. My first Scarpetta novel was "TRACE" so I wanted to go back and read and earlier one. A fan recommended this one. But I still found the characters not particularly likeable. I can't stand Lucy.The plot was excellent and the forensic evidence pieces flawless. But there are so many holes and unconnected dots. And the whole plot changes from being about a killer, and who is killing these people and why to Scarpetta getting out of the accusations. I found the ending somewhat disappointing, not enough clear focus on Waddell and what exactly was going on there. All the focus was on the case against Scarpetta.

review/summary: ALL THE PLOT HOLES IN THIS BOOK ARE CRUEL AND UNUSUAL
review/text: Granted this is one of Cornwell's better books and I have read them all, so I can attest to that fact. I recently went back and read this book, just to try to remember if the woman ever could really write, and my conclusion is yes, she once was quite good. This book is fast paced and Scarpetta is at her best, but still, as with all of Cornwell's books, this book is full of plot holes and the most incredulous coincidences, it's like a Cornwell trademark..warning spoiler alert...here are just some of the miriad of plot holes...I mean why would the warden let out this nut?..and how on earth did he do it? why not just contract somebody on the outside to find the briefcase..why the cloak and dagger with the fingerprints, why didnt the guy just wear gloves, then it would not have mattered, why on earth was the governor trying to ruin Scarpetta?...why were the warden and govenor trying to make it look like this guy executed was not actually the one executed..what was the point?..then all the stuff on Mark dying and Scarpetta giving the guy that helped him, 10,000 dollars..WHAT?!!!..then what was all that stuff with the bull dike prison guard..who had this Psycho in her house then later he decapitates her..why?..we are never told..why on earth did Scapetta and Marino not ask for back up to get Gault?..then they let him escape out the window and dont even bother to run after him..WHAT?!!..and at the beginning of the book, the killer kills a boy and stages him like a woman killed years ago..why not select a girl..why a boy?..if your trying to copycat..it makes no since at all...then all that stuff with that guy in her office..stealing the fingerprints along with this other woman that gets killed by the psycho..and im thinking..the govenor and warden where having this nut, pay the people their getting to frame Scarpetta...that makes absolutely no sense at all..there is more..i could go on and on..unfortunitely, this Temple Gault ends up in her later books, he's such a ridiculous character..something out of Silence of the Lambs..you can tell that book and movie were popular at the time these book are written because Gault is straight out of the mind of Thomas Harris..I do recommend reading this book, but you really need to not think at all about the idiosy of these people and all the holes..honestly with all the holes it's amazing this book holds together both figuratively and literally

review/summary: Best of the First Four in this series.
review/text: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always "one against the world", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.

review/text: The first 75% of this book is a 10. Cornwell sets up the perfect novel, albeit with a rather drab, reactive protagonist, but then suddenly swerves off the road and goes bonkers. For me the peak of the book was when Kay Scarpetta is threatened by the governor and is suspended from her job, but then Cornwell finds a way to tie this great, believable plot into, of all things, a Nazi war criminal, and that's where she totally lost me. Then there's absolutely no climax or showdown whatsoever. We just hear about the acts of the murderer second hand, and that was a big letdown, too

Details concerning autopsies, computer mainframes, police procedures, etc. are informative but don't go overboard on descriptions. I only wish I could read faster, couldn't put it down

review/text: The first 75% of this book is a 10. Cornwell sets up the perfect novel, albeit with her rather drab, reactive protagonist, but then suddenly swerves off the road and goes bonkers. For me the peak of the book was when Kay Scarpetta is threatened by the governor and is suspended from her job, but then Cornwell finds a way to tie this great, believable plot into, of all things, a Nazi war criminal, and that's where she totally lost me. Then there's absolutely no climax or showdown whatsoever. We just hear about the acts of the murderer second hand, and that was a big letdown, too

review/text: to follow her own work. A superb 'next in series' not to be skipped over. Great plot although I thought it came together too neatly at the conclusion. The author's ingenuity and thought processes have made both Cornwell and Dr. Scarpetta reading buddies of mine. You will love this novel if forensics and mysteries thrill you. I guarantee you will enjoy not only this one but the entire series.

review/text: I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set (not as a cassette set) so I ordered it. I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book. I wrote (through Amazon) to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD set.The Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it. Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book (so I wouldn't have to pay the Library charge), I now had to give that job to the library. Need I say more?This time, and it's the first time, Amazon has a very disgruntled customer.Thanks for asking for the review. Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experienced.Sincerely,Sherry BohmP.S. Yes, my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers. We're just going to have to be more careful now.

review/summary: Lots of loose ends.
review/text: I really like both this author and her popular heroine Dr. Kay Scarpetta because of the maturity of the character in addition to the stoicism that is displayed by her cool and collected manner. She is the ultimate professional. This book "Cruel and Unusual" is not up to the author's personal standards set in other books such as "Trace" which is one of the very best she has written to date.I have spent the past 10 minutes rereading parts of this book and am still confused by the mishmash ending. I don't have a real clue what happened to the bad guys here. Where is the ravening beast convict who was released from prison and resulted in a number of unsolved murders as one example? There is a lot of personal stuff to soften and "humanize" the image of Dr. Scarpetta, but even with the snarky neice Lucy with her smart alecky mouth, there is still the steely and distant feel to Dr. Scarpetta. I like that a lot.IMO, the absolute worst thing an author can do to a strong female character is to make her suddenly get "melting bones" or those insipid hormonal storms, a la the Nora Roberts style, et al, that stimulate their "broody" instincts at the first sight of an acceptable male and the next topic becomes gooey babies and sucky conversations with relatives rather than science and focus and dedication to one's career that makes for a tight, fascinating and worthwhile read.So, with that in mind, this book gets a 4 pointer simply because Ms. Cornwell avoids the "romance-crime drama" pitfalls and forges ahead with a decent, albeit patchy and vague story. I am glad that the author has also forged ahead in her craft and her subsequent stories are sooooo much better than this one.

review/summary: What if the death row criminal hadn't died?
review/text: Another test drive into the world of mystery, this book is my first book written by Patricia Cornwall.Life as a medical examiner isn't easy for Kay Scarpetta, particularly when fingerprints of a man killed in the electric chair appear at the scene of a crime a few days after he was killed. Then, after the death of her assistant, Susan Story, Kay becomes implicated in the crime. Can she discover the true killer before she ends up either in jail or dead herself?What I Liked:First off, I enjoyed Cornwell's writing style. She writes with intelligence and detail, brining you into the very scene. The autopsies, the attention to detail (particularly in relation to Eddie and Jennifer), the thorough regard for the scenery all made it very easy to transport myself to Virginia with Dr. Scarpetta.Further, the story was pretty interesting and left you guessing. When I opened the book, I would have had no clue of the outcome, which was surprising (if, in a sense, a little disappointing as well). Several seemingly unrelated people die, but somehow Cornwall is able to tie their deaths in at the very end.My favorite characters included Benton Wesley, Marino, and, of course, Kay. Benton was an intelligent man, kind and someone Kay could turn to. But he almost held an aristocratic air. Marino, on the other hand, was more down to earth. I enjoyed his arguing with Lucy and how the gruff man ended up coming to Christmas to Kay's after all. Finally, I grew fond of Kay. At first, I found her hard to approach, but then I realized that was her personality anyway. As the story progressed, I felt I got more of a handle on who she was and what she wanted. Further, I enjoyed how she paid attention to detail and thought things through logically.What I Did Not Like:Now, this could be due to my taking a month longer than I should have to finish this book, but I felt the story was slow (but not in an obvious "Will this book ever end?" fashion). I was plugging along and realized, "Hm, I'm halfway through and still have no clue how the heck this is going to end". This is not necessarily bad, but I would certainly not classify this book as one of those racing thrillers that keeps you on the edge of your seat every moment.My biggest complaint has to be the character of Lucy. She is probably the most annoying character in the book. Her selfish, bratty whining made me wish frequently she would go home. Her actual purpose in the book was so small, I have no idea why she was included for most of it! All she did was discover the message left in Kay's computer and that AFIS had been corrupted. I felt that Cornwall was repetitively shoving Lucy away because she was in the way (sending her to ski with Benton's wife, having her left home alone while Kay ran around doing errands, etc.). And I have a hard time believing that a 17 year old could be such a computer brainiac. I think the story would have been much better without her.Lastly, I felt the ending was rather rushed, the story concluding rather hastily in the last 10 pages or so, almost as if Cornwall was being pushed to get the story done and hurriedly threw the last bits together.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Dialogue is relatively tame, considering the genre. A few d***, h***, ba*****, and some wandering appearances of the f-word.Lucy complains about her mother's promiscuity and asks Kay if her aunt will have an affair. Kay's lover is brought up. Marino goes home with a woman after a Christmas party.Finally, three people are killed in the course of this book (well, more if you count Waddell, the death row criminal, and his victim). The autopsies describe the injuries, which can make the squeamish squeam. Also an explosion is described in retrospect.Overall:My first thought at finishing this is "Ho-hum". "Cruel and Unusual" is not really a bad book. It is well written and fairly interesting. I just felt that parts drug more than they should and really couldn't stand certain nameless (LUCY!) characters. 3 stars.Brought to you by*C.S. Light*

review/text: If your looking for a suspensful thriller you'll find it with Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. In it the main charicter, Dr. Kay Scarpetta a medical examiner, finds herself traped in a web of murders. Her investigations of them lead her back to a conspiracy which is being covered up in her own legal department. I found the book to be disturbing as well as compeling at the same time. The first of it was a little crowded and hard to follow but it improved as it went on. It was more then I expected it to be. The more I read, the more involved I became and I couldn't put it down. One of the best mystery books I've read.

Eventually, with the help of pete Marino, Benton Wesley and Lucy, she finds the killer, but not without her whole reputation being almost ruined.If you've never read any of Pc's books you HAVE TO read this.

review/text: Just started reading Patricia Cornwell two months ago. This is my 4th book, which I find to be the best one thus far. Postmortem, Body Farm,From Potters Field were the others I have read. This plot is the most interestingly complex of the four and her character (good and bad side) comes out throughout the novel. What I liked the most is the constant interplay of characters, their areas of expertise , and the tasteful way she handles the most gruesome situations. This book is fast-paced and very much fun to read. I look forward to the rest of them.

I read the entire book in a one night sitting, turning page after page, and I haven't done that since &quot;Jurrasic Park&quot;. This is a must read for everyone! When I first read a Cornwell book, I was traditional and read her first, and I must say that Postmortem was awful, but I gave her another chance, picked this one off of the shelf, and have never regretted it. I have loved Cornwell's books ever since giving them and Kay Scarpetta another chance. If you want a good thrill and an excellent book, pick this one up.

review/summary: Plot hole dampens...plot
review/text: In this fourth installment of the Kay Scarpetta series, we find the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia chasing a most challenging miscreant - a murderer with no pattern to his destruction except the intent to play games with the authorities hunting him. The book is a must-read for those addicted to Cornwell's well-researched suspense novels, since it sets the stage for a showdown in From Potter's Field. But a major plot hole revealed in the first few pages leaves the reader feeling cheated for the remainder of the novel.We enter the story with Scarpetta recovering from the death of a close friend. While this development certainly bodes well for future plot twists, it leaves the reader frustrated with the current one. The few details of the death surface mostly at the end of the story and while we're told of Scarpetta's devastation, we really don't witness it. Seasoned Cornwell fans are accustomed to these shallow depths in characterization but it nonetheless puts a damper on an otherwise entertaining mystery.

review/summary: One bad egg is forgiveable
review/text: This is the worst of the Scarpetta series. which is quite an achievement seeing as all the others are brilliant. My favourites being the claustrophobic &quot;The Body Farm&quot;, and the superbly dark &quot;Point of Origin&quot;. I have loved all the Scarpetta's, and read them at least twice over, and i still think this is the worst.The plot was very complicated, and it all seemed a bit of a mess. The characters were nothing special, and i this is the only book in which Cornwell manage to bore me with her normally insightful computer terminology. It's too long, and basically i dont think it has any substance. There is a great potential. The idea for the plot is superb, and could well have been one of the best, but somewhere along the line it all slips. I cant put my finger on it, but i just didnt come away from this with the satisfaction i normally get out of a Kay Scarpetta book.Nevertheless this is still a necessary book to read if you intend to read the entire series. It is one of the major turning points. The first book to feature Temple Gault, who would later lead to Carrie Grethen, Newton Joyce, and all the other catastrophic events which culminate in the next turning point of &quot;The Last Precint&quot;. each one has signalled a new era for Patricia Cornwell, and each one has not been quite as good as the others. But The Last Precint was still much better than this. It is, admittedly, very clever, but far too complicated, and im surprised it got the CWA's gold dagger.nevertheless, i have given it two stars purely because it is such a major point in Scarpetta's life. You must read it if you intend to read the entire series, but dont expect to enjoy it as much as you do the others.

review/text: I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and thought I'd give it a whirl. I never expected to fall in love with a character and an author quite so quickly! From the first page to the last, it's a can't-put-down book. I love the idea of having a fingerprint from a recently-executed criminal show up at a new crime scene. And I love how they determine throughout the whirling pace of the book how this could be possible and who the real killer is. Great ending, superb characters and dialogue. Cornwell is a mistress of her field and has great credentials -- having worked for a medical investigator -- to boot! Anyone who hasn't read this book should drop everything they're doing and read it.

review/summary: Cornwell's Magic
review/text: Dr. Kay Scarpetta is in it up to her neck this time. A death row inmate, Waddle, is executed, but before his body is even cool, murdered corpses start piling up with Waddle's fingerprints found at the scene of the crime. Next thing you know, people are dropping like flies, some of them close to Dr. Kay, and she is publicly implicated in the deaths.Cornwell has written a workably entertaining mystery here. The plot is engaging and bubbling with intrigue, and the writing isn't hampered by too much extraneous detail or incidental goings-ons. There is a subplot with Kay's niece, Lucy, that I found a tad ingratiating and annoying, but for anyone reading the Scarpetta mysteries in order, it is an understandable and rather necessary bit of character development.I do, however, object to Cornwell relegating some of the more serious character development to the back story. I'm talking about the sudden death of Kay's long-time love interest, Mark, (and, to a lesser extent, her decision to quit smoking). These are pretty significant events in Kay's life, and to leave them in the background as part of the story dressing seems at odds with an author who wants us to sympathize with her character.To that end, some of the story ended up either ringing false to me, or just falling flat. For example, there is much made of Kay's financial secrets, which she refers to in connection with embarassment and rage. When the secrets are finally revealed, I found them to be maudlin and a little silly. It baffled me why Kay would take such pains to keep them hidden.Furthermore, I respect Cornwell's decision to keep her novels secured solely in the Holmesian realm of mystery solving, but this means that there is very little action in the book, and a lot of key details are discussed and reviewed over and over again by the characters. It makes for repetitive reading. It also means that the actual discovery of the culprit's identity is never as important as the sleuthing that went into discovering that identity.In other words, if you're looking for closure with this story, you won't get much. Cornwell does a great job of setting up quite a puzzler, and it will keep you guessing. But, much like a magician with an amazing magic trick, once you learn the secret, you're bound to be a little disappointed.

review/summary: Cliffhanger
review/text: First of all, this book really should receive 3.5 stars, but due to the lack of &quot;half-stars&quot; in Amazon.com's rating system, a mere three will have to do. This is my fifth Patricia Cornwell book, but definitely is not my favorite. The plot was terrific--the idea of a death row inmate possibly escaping from prison is a frightening concept, especially since Cornwell is always right on the ball when it comes to accuracy of details. As always, the characters are so realistic that the reader often must test himself to remember that they are indeed fictional. This book got a five star rating from me until about halfway when political injustices against the main character intervened. Although this was a good idea for a plot twist, it seemed that Cornwell was digressing from the main idea of the story, taking the reader into another story completely separate from what we read in the beginning. The ending was a disappointment--throughout the story, Cornwell is setting the reader up for the usual great climax where the perpetrator is discovered and captured and all is well--and then, it doesn't happen. In my opinion, it seemed like the ending was written by not Cornwell, but another author who rushed to complete this chapter of Kay Scarpetta's adventures as soon as possible. Overall, Cruel and Unusual was a good book that unfortunately could have been a great book if the right elements had been present.

review/summary: Muddled ending disapoints
review/text: The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw.

review/text: Ah, the good old days of Dr. Scarpetta and her gang of crime solvers. This book represents one of the glory days of Cornwell's writing. I reread CRUEL AND UNUSUAL whenever I wish to return to a time when I actually liked Scarpetta.The plot is ingenious. An executed inmate's fingerprints turn up at another crime scene. How could this possibly happen? Perhaps he's still alive, having been switched with another inmate instead of dying himself. Perhaps the truth is more twisted and harrowing than even Dr. Scarpetta can imagine. When Kay's implicated in the murder of one of her workers she has to find the reason behind the fingerprints to save herself and those close to her.

review/summary: Blah...
review/text: I must have missed something... reading &quot;Cruel and Unusual&quot; and &quot;The Alienist&quot; at the same time, C&amp;E wasn't remotely in the latter's league. They aren't even playing the same sport. I knew when I picked it up that C&amp;E would be pulp entertainment and nothing more, but I'm still disappointed.The plot was reasonably interesting but the way that everything fell so neatly into place at the end seemed forced. What passed for character development was more like being beat over the head with a ten-pound hammer: we know that Kay is cold and detached, that Lucy needs to be loved, and so on. I knew it the first time Cornwell told me. To tell -- not show -- me again and again, always in the same exact way, the same conversations, made me roll my eyes with boredom. Plus, the characters were so one-dimensional, I just didn't care.Ultimately, though, you read a mystery novel for the mystery, and I just didn't find it that interesting. The killer was boring and came out of the blue, the twists not particularly interesting, and the villains, such as they were, not particularly villainous.All in all, a decent read but not much more. I went in looking for fluff, and came away a bit disappointed.

review/summary: My favorite Scarpetta
review/text: This is the 4th book in Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels. I have read two others (Cause of Death and Black Notice) before this one, but this is my favorite of the three. Cruel and Unusual contains elements found in the other Scarpetta novels (difficult conversations with her mother and sister, major neuroses revolving around her niece, Lucy, internal plots hatched to ruin Scarpetta, and expecting Pete Marino to drop dead from his excesses at any second), but not to the point where I found the repetition annoying. If anything, I want to see more of these familiar characters. The autopsy details seemed less excessive and the pace was quicker.Cruel and Unusual begins with the execution of a rapist/murderer, and the following autopsy of the felon. Shortly thereafter, a string of seemingly unconnected murders erupt around Richmond. Scarpetta finds one common strand - all appear to be committed by the supposedly dead convict. As if this isn't bad enough, her assistant is murdered and the press indicts Scarpetta.As always, Cornwell's knowledge of forensic medicine and the law were put to good use. If you are unfamiliar with Scarpetta and the other familiar characters, don't worry. Although she doesn't bore with long recaps, she doesn't assume you know every prior detail either.

review/summary: Mrs. Radcliffe: First Lady of Historical Fiction
review/text: Valancourt Books' recent publication of Mrs. Radcliffe's Gaston de Blondeville is a publication long overdue. The novel, originally published in 1826, three years after the mistress of the Gothic's death, was actually written by her in 1803, but then suppressed by her from publication. The general belief is that she disowned the novel, thinking it inferior to her other work; literary historians have also claimed that readers agreed and greeted its publication with little enthusiasm. The primary reason usually given for why it is inferior is that it is the only one of Radcliffe's Gothic novels where she chose to use a real ghost rather than explain what appeared to be supernatural occurrences. The general reader, and especially the student of Gothic and historical fiction, should be allowed to judge the matter for himself and now that Valancourt Books has republished Gaston de Blondeville, that decision can be made.Gaston de Blondeville, while admittedly not as full of chills and suspense as The Mysteries of Udolpho or The Italian, is a remarkable novel in Radcliffe's canon. It marks a noted departure from her earlier novels, and in many ways, it displays her growth and restraint as an author. Considering all her previous novels were published between the time she was twenty-five and thirty-three, a remarkably young age for someone to write three of the greatest Gothic novels of all time, as well as a couple inferior ones, it is not surprising that Radcliffe sought to move in a new direction in her work. Gaston de Blondeville was the beginning of her growth in that new direction, and had she written another like it, readers may have had a real treat in an even greater Radcliffe.My only criticism of Valancourt Books' edition of Gaston de Blondeville--which is filled with a superb collection of secondary sources and an impressive scholarly introduction by Frances Chiu to reflect the historical and political influences of the French Revolution upon the novel--is that no attempt is made in these supplementary materials to explain why Radcliffe made this departure from her past use of rational explanations for supposed supernatural occurrences. I believe that departure is the big question that must be answered about this novel, especially since Radcliffe was otherwise striving to be more realistic from a historical standpoint.Despite what is typically said about Gaston de Blondeville by literary historians, the six contemporary reviews provided in this edition are largely favorable. In her introduction, Frances Chiu quotes these reviews to argue that literary critics condemned the novel, but in truth, only one review is solidly negative while the rest express great enthusiasm for a new work by Mrs. Radcliffe. Chiu quotes La Belle Assemblee as saying "it is without the lofty pretensions of some of Mrs. Radcliffe's earlier productions, and incapable of exciting an equal intenseness of interest" but Chiu fails to quote what comes directly after: "it will not in the slightest degree detract from the fame of her" and "it will be read with great satisfaction by every reader of taste." Scots Magazine was pleased that the novel does not include so much of her poetry which is not remarkable at all, and overall feels the novel is an improvement on her earlier work because "She avoided long particulars of rural scenery, and tedious trackings of the agitated mind, from one terrible or sorrowful imagination to another." In fact, the only review that is truly negative is the Monthly Review, which does find parts of the work to praise but chiefly objects to its use of the supernatural.Why Radcliffe decided to include supernatural events as a reality has not been given a good explanation. Perhaps she felt the supernatural was more acceptable to the reading public by the earlier nineteenth century, nearly fifteen years after she wrote her first Gothic novel. While she may have been in competition with other Gothic writers, her contemporaries, such as Matthew Lewis in The Monk (1795) and William Godwin in St. Leon (1799), were not beyond using the supernatural as a possibility, so perhaps she need no longer provide rational explanations for supernatural events. Greater study is needed of how the view toward the supernatural changed and became acceptable in literature, especially during this period as the "Age of Reason" was replaced by the horrors of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.What I find more remarkable about Gaston de Blondeville than Radcliffe's use of the supernatural is that it is one of the earliest historical fiction novels. Sir Walter Scott is often credited with being the first major writer of historical fiction, but historical fiction certainly has its roots in Gothic novels with their typically medieval settings. The difference between Gothic and historical fiction is the concentration on a much more realistic historical world. The Gothic typically sets its novels in a more vaguely historical period or avoids attention to historic detail. A key component to historical fiction is the depiction of historical events and historical personages in the background of the novel, such as the Battle of Culloden as the background to Scott's Waverley (1814). If that is true, then I would argue that Radcliffe is our first true female historical novelist since Gaston de Blondeville, although not published until 1826, was written in 1803, a full six years before Jane Porter's The Scottish Chiefs (1809), that tremendous novel about Sir William Wallace, and only three years after Godwin's St. Leon (1799) which only really attains historical fiction status due to its including the historical character of Bethlem Gabor in its pages. (Arguments have been made that Clara Reeve is the first female writer of historical fiction, but I don't feel her work is historically detailed enough to merit such a claim). Radcliffe is far more historically detailed than Godwin in her descriptions of the court of Henry III and in the details she provides of that age of chivalry, tournaments, and medieval monasteries. While her novel may not have had the influence on historical fiction that Scott's works did, and therefore, she may not be the mother of historical fiction, not having led to the birth of similar historical works, as she was for Gothic novels, she certainly is the aunt, who has been kept like a skeleton in the closet, while Gaston de Blondeville has been treated as if it were better not to be talked about it, lest it ruin the Mistress of Gothic Literature's good name.I encourage all lovers of Gothic and historical fiction to read Gaston de Blondeville to make up their own minds. I personally find the novel a much more concise, controlled and mature work, and if not as fascinating and suspenseful as her previous works, one that deserves further attention. If Mrs. Radcliffe had written and published a couple more historical novels after Gaston de Blondeville, I have no doubt she would have rivaled Sir Walter Scott for his dominant place as a writer of historical fiction.

review/summary: The only Radcliffe novel with a real ghost!
review/text: I am with the publisher, Valancourt Books, and wanted to post this description from the book's back cover, since Amazon has not done so:King Henry III is holding court at Kenilworth. Festivities abound, wine flows copiously, and spirits are high as the King and his subjects prepare to celebrate the nuptials of Sir Gaston de Blondeville. But the joyous mood is interrupted when a merchant, Hugh Woodreeve, comes distraught before the King to demand justice. His kinsman, he claims, was murdered, by the very man the King has come to honour -- Gaston de Blondeville!Suspecting a conspiracy against Gaston, yet obliged to hold a trial to determine the truth of the allegations, Henry imprisons Woodreeve in a tower while awaiting a hearing. Meanwhile, sinister forces are at work, represented by an evil abbot, who will stop at nothing to ensure the truth behind Woodreeve's claims is never revealed.As the trial unfolds and the danger mounts for both Woodreeve and Gaston, a mysterious figure will come from beyond the grave to elucidate the horrible mystery!The only one of Radcliffe's novels to feature a real ghost, Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This edition, the first-ever scholarly edition of the novel, features a new introduction by Frances Chiu, uncoding the novel's long-hidden political, historical, and religious contexts. A wealth of supplementary materials, including excerpts from other primary texts and the complete text of contemporary reviews, is also provided to enhance modern readers' understanding of the novel's themes.

review/summary: A Medieval Murder Trial
review/text: A King is honoring a nobleman, yet an accuser comes forward and accuses the nobleman of murder. The accuser is put into jail. They plan to execute the accuser. The King has a supporter, a crooked abbot, who plots against the accuser. A ghost of the murder victim appears here and there to somehow explain the injustice and that leads the accuser to be thought to be involved in sorcery. That is the book in a nut shell! A Medieval Murder Trial. Not the usual Ann Radcliffe but the book is interesting and I recommend it!

review/summary: So the actors don't make it up as they go?
review/text: This is an entertaining and educational little volume of interviews with twelve screenwriters from Hollywood's &quot;golden age.&quot; These folks all have tales of being disrespected and demeaned by producers and directors and of being thwarted in creating their art. But they all survived and even thrived a little and have plenty of tales humorous and horrendous of goings on in the movie business. From Ivy-League intellectual to newspaperman to truck driver, the subjects of these interviews have in common the storyteller's knack, and that makes this book a delight for those of us who like to know what goes on behind the scenes. I wish there were twice as many interviews, though. Filmographies for the subjects appear at the back of the book, and there's a generous helping of photos throughout.

review/summary: Too scattered, too shallow
review/text: Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books.

review/summary: Tremendously entertaining mixture of fable and wisdom
review/text: This is a very entertaining tale of a clever cyncial rabbi's cat on the surface. However, the tale goes much further than exploring the cat's desire to anthropomorphise. It deals with father-daughter relationships, love, obedience, the stiffling influence of tradition, clashes between cultures, etc. It is uniquely influenced by Jewish theological exegesis and rabbinical commentary. Moreso than Will Eisner's work which was a landmark in this area (also on Amazon).I liked the artwork in the main. Panels are loosely framed on the pages which gives a light flow to the narrative. Colours are strong and mediterranean when needs be. I have two reservations however. Firstly, some of the pieces are overdrawn. Too much unnecessary detail in a scene. Text in the speech bubbles is squeezed at times and as a middle aged person with spectacles I found it hard to read on occasion. My reading wuld have been easier if overall frame size was bigger. Secondly, and this is my major reservation, the whole tale is told primarily through language used by the characters rather than through the characters actions. In other words as a graphic novel, I thought it was too wordy. You may well observe, that it is ironic that a graphic novel based around the culture of the 'people of the Book' repeats the textual propensity of much Jewish self-commentary. Eisner, to my mind, has the text-visual balance better defined. However, these are personal aesthetic opinions and shouldn't detract from the overall conceptual achievement which is exemplary.

review/summary: A wonderful & enlightening book.
review/text: This is a one-volume, hard-cover, adult graphic novel about a Rabbi's cat who gets the power to speak. This novel was originally published in France, in three volumes, spread over three years. It's a wonderful book.By the way, Joann is a guy's name, in France. Maybe, it's an old French spelling of John or Jean. According to the book's jacket blurb, Sfar is one of the "brightest and most talented of the younger generation of French comic artists." He has written or collaborated on over one hundred books for adults & children. Sfar received the prestigious Jury Award at Angouleme for The Rabbi's Cat.This book will be enlightening for most people & especially for most Jewish-Americans. The three connected stories are about Algerian Jews in the 1930s, in both Algeria & France. My knowledge of this area of Jewish life & history is negligible. IThe cat in this book gains the power of speech by eating & swallowing the family's pet parrot. The cat ends up having theological & philosophical discussions with the Rabbi. The cat wants to study Kabbalah & get Bar Mitzvahed. They debate both Western thought & Jewish thought.Through the cat's eyes we listen in on the discussions of the Rabbi's students. We learn who are studious & who are vain, arrogant & self-important. We see the Rabbi turn to his own Master with his problems; but, through the cat's eyes we see this Master as less knowledgeable than his disciple. We see a Master who spouts foolishness because he knows of his own inferiority.We learn of the anti-Semitism faced by Jews in Algeria from the non-Jewish French settlers. Many of the Jews had been living in Algeria for centuries & had adopted Arab dress, food & customs. These Jews were turned away from French restaurants & other establishments. They usually felt more at home with the native Algerians; yet, always faced an undercurrent of nonacceptance. Even the French-Jewish establishment, centered in Paris, forced the leaders & Rabbis of the Algerian Jewish community to adapt to French ways, customs & speech. If such leaders & Rabbis couldn't pass demeaning grade school exams showing proficiency in French, they would be replaced; even though all native Algerian Jews spoke Hebrew & Arabic which had enabled them to get along quite well for those previous centuries.Through the cat's eyes we see the title Rabbi's struggle for acceptance by the French Jewish establishment. He is a great man in Algeria & is being considered for the post of Chief Rabbi. First he must pass this silly grade school exam. Readers see his agony & self-doubt. We see his complete joy at passing the exam & his own humbleness.We see friendship between himself & his Arab friends. We learn about Algerian Jews who have gone totally native, living like Nomadic warriors in the desert; at home with guns, knives & lions. We learn about the differences between Algerian Jews & French Jews in the pre-WWII period. We learn about street performers & Algerian Jews who must masquerade asArabs to make a living in France; as the French know almost nothing about Jews from Algeria who live like Arabs but are Jews.It's a wonderful book. There is much to learn about love, loyalty, marriage, family, hypocrisy, bravery, humbleness, friendship, loss, merriment, true riches, anti-Semitism and more. All of this is contained within less than 150 pages of a graphic novel, or what the French call, an adult comic book.

review/text: It is rare that I laugh out loud at a graphic novel but I was completely charmed by this book. The story is endearing, and the characters are like people you either know or would like to know. In some of the religious debates with the Rabbi's Rabbi, the cat is like Groucho Marx, reincarnated in a feline form.Beautifully illustrated, the Rabbi's Cat has, in my opinion, entered the pantheon of great cat characters, such as Krazy Kat, Puss in Boots, Fritz the Cat, and Catwoman, as played by Eartha Kitt.Warning: If you a totally serious person, with fixed views on religion, this book is not for you

review/summary: Judaism through a cat's lovingly irreverent eyes
review/text: Why is this book different from all other books?It is one of the most creative works I have read, whether in the category of ethnic fiction, graphic novels or books about animals. I've never seen a book that so honestly discusses an insider's ambivalence about his culture, and from such an unusual perspective. Through the eyes of the Rabbi's cat, this graphic novel relates the story of a Rabbi in 1930s Algeria and France. The Rabbi faces many challenges in navigating his 3,500 year old faith and tradition as the modern world encroaches. He has spent much of his life studying the holy books and commentaries, which provide answers to many questions from cosmic theology to everyday existence. However, he continually encounters situations his religious education did not prepare him for--from his (talking) cat's unorthodox ideas about Judaism; to his cat's desire, unprecedented for an animal, to join the Jewish tribe; to a place the Rabbi visits that does not accommodate the pious Jewish way of life. In the end, the Rabbi faces these dilemmas and difficulties with a mind of his own, in contrast to other characters who either capitulate to secularism or withdraw into hard-line and often damaging religiosity. One of the book's themes is that love and dedication, whether to other people or even to a tradition as legalistic as Judaism's, may not always mean strict obedience. In this, the cat, who is willing to dare "sacrilegious magic" to try and help his beloved master, is a most compelling narrator. The cat watches with a sympathetic eye as the humans around him live, struggle and at times bend the rules.Although the prose contains many gems, Sfar's drawings leave something to be desired. In particular, the cat pictures mostly fail to capture a real feline's taciturn dignity, otherwordly softness and glowing-eyed, nocturnal mystique. The human facial expressions and body language, however, add subtleties that could not be achieved in other genres. The colorist, Brigitte Findakly, more than compensates for Sfar's shortcomings as an artist. With a bright, earthy palette, Findakly adds flavor to Sfar's Algeria and France, creating an inviting world for the reader to step into. Occasional profanity, sexual scenes and complicated themes may make _The Rabbi's Cat_ unsuitable for some young children; older children and adults should definitely read this fascinating and compelling book!Familiarity with Jewish theology, law and culture will enhance one's appreciation and understanding of _The Rabbi's Cat_. For a background in the book's cultural context, the curious may want to read _Judaism for Dummies_ or its counterparts in the _Idiot's Guide_ series; in addition, _Jews, God and History_ by Max I. Dimont is my favorite overview of Jewish history and would provide an excellent introduction to the historical context of _The Rabbi's Cat_. _Jews, God and History_ reveals that even before modern times, Judaism was almost never static--to the contrary, and like most healthy traditions, it has continually evolved and developed many historical branches as it adapted to its ever changing environment. Sadly, Jews were expelled from most Arab countries as the region's antisemitism increased in the mid-20th century; however, a world that approximates the Rabbi's might still exist in some Sephardic Jewish Modern Orthodox communities that maintain their traditions while accommodating secular culture. Chabad Lubavitch, a branch of basically traditional Judaism that originated in Eastern Europe, is a bit different but is much more open to answering questions and meeting with outsiders, complete with worldwide "Chabad houses" for the purpose. A moderate Judaism like the Rabbi's and an irreverent Judaism like his cat's can be found in the more progressive Conservative, Masorti, Reform, Reconstructionist and UK Liberal movements.

review/summary: What Does the Torah Say About Animals that Talk?
review/text: As a Jewish American, I've always been fascinated by the experiences our people in the Diaspora. The lives of American, British, French, and Algerian Jews are all different. We can be found in the unlikeliest of places; Cuba, Mexico City, Rio, Mumbai, Dublin (I'm not joking, there are Jews in Ireland).I once boarded with a Jewish family in Strasbourg. Their lives were much different from those of New York Jews; they kept a lower profile, avoided gentiles, and their eating habits were more like those of their neighbors (no bagels, herring, or kugel on their table). British Jews, respectively, make a greater effort to appear "English" while avoiding non-Jews. You won't see cockneys eating in Jewish delis (not that I saw any Jewish delis in London aside from Bloom's).The Rabbi's Cat has a very quirky story that's not easy to summarize. A scrawny cat gains the power of speech and engages his master, a Rabbi, in debates. The Rabbis gorgeous daughter, having no interest in philosophy (and having no work to do) loves this cat as if he were an irritating younger sibling.Zlabya is your typical Arabian-Nights-Fantasy though she happens to be Jewish. She marries a French Jew of Turkish origin, and some funny conflicts arise; he bores her, she feels self-conscious of her background, and her father isn't sure why the French Jews lack vitality. Or is he just too... full of life?I'm glad that graphic-novel fans will learn about the Jews of France thanks to this book. The Jews have been an important part of French society for years, but with the way things are going now, it may not last. Jews have been leaving France in greater number since 2001, and I hope they don't all leave for Israel, UK, or the USA. It would be a shame for France to lose such a great part of its culture.

review/summary: Wonderful, baffling mix
review/text: This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird

review/summary: Sharp, engrossing & delightful
review/text: I started going to the comic book store with my husband who's a life-long die-hard fan of all things related to comics, graphic novels, whatever you prefer to call them. Perusing on my own, I found The Rabbi's Cat, and lured by the art and a short preview, I bought both volumes. I ended up completely engrossed and read through them both in three nights.These books are for grown-ups, not children, although I understand Mr. Sfar also creates books for young readers. I love his drawings and panels. They're loose, energetic, rich in texture and color, and impart the feel of the settings and the life-force of the characters. The dialogue is lively and smart. There's a lot going on in these stories connected by the presence of The Cat. The story and environments change; sometimes the characters are excited and welcoming of the changes and sometimes not. I hated to see one story line end, but then the next one would pick up and I would be carried along by it engrossed and curious to see what happened next. It's a very human story set in a complex place and time. The characters struggle to keep their faith and balance in the midst of it all. They succeed, fail, learn, and are forged.And the cat is very, very true: smart, self-possessed, jealously devoted to his "masters," and on equal or better intellectual footing compared to the human characters.

review/summary: Great introduction to Jewish practices
review/text: A widowed rabbi, his cat and his daughter live in Algeria spin a story and lesson in Judaism very cleverly crafted in this graphic novel. Through the cat, who having eaten the family parrot, is imparted a miraculous ability to speak, questions and challenges to the Jewish faith are presented to the rabbi and the rabbi's rabbi. First the cat lies about eating the parrot, and then he insists on learning the Kabbalah and wants a Bar Mitzvah.The rabbi's daughter gets married to a French rabbi and they honeymoon in Paris to meet with the in-laws. The widowed rabbi and the cat accompany them and the rabbi's faith is tested along the way, as well as his tolerance for those who don't practice the faith as he is believes it should be practiced.You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate this graphic novel. It's funny, sad and is a wonderful little theological study.

review/summary: A charming piece of work
review/text: I didn't exactly like the look of the cat, though I have to admit a good resemblance to the artist's own pet.The story begins in Algeria. A rabbi's cat ate a parrot, and suddenly finds himself able to speak. To his master's consternation, the cat immediately begins to tell lies ("I didn't eat any parrot!") The rabbi decides to educate him in the way of the Torah, and the cat insists he wants a Bar Mitzvah, and that by cat's age he is well past thirteen.The author cleverly works interesting questions about religion and culture into the story in a charming, humorous and witty way. There is a magic, a tenderness in the story telling. The cat looks a bit devilish in the beginning, but his unique view of things make for interesting narration. The rabbi character is so disarmingly endearing in his honesty, and his love for his cat and his daughter, it's impossible not to love him.

review/text: This book is absolutely delightful! It is a shear pleasure to read. It both makes you smile and think. It is both light and deep. It is a fitting testimony to the fact that a graphic novel is not just a comic book on steroids. So when you read it, do not forget to study the pictures closely.

review/text: Beautiful book! Joann Sfar wonderfully illustrates some classic questions about human identity, Jewish identity, the human condition, and the Jewish human condition. The humor is constantly refreshing, enhancing the depth of some philosophical episodes and keeping the tone simultaneously light and serious. I expect to read and reference this book often.

review/summary: A wonderful, funny-sad book
review/text: The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.

review/summary: My Rabbi loved this book too
review/text: This book is great fun to read. The cat is a wonderful character, particularly when he is arguing theology and Talmud. I suspect if cats really could talk and argue theology, they'd act much like the one drawn in this book. In fact the book was inspired by the author's real cat (who doesn't speak, at least that I know of :-)) but apparently does understand how to keep his humans.This book can be enjoyed on several levels - as a fable about a cat and his humans, as a series of theological and philosophical debates, or just as a fun story about a talking cat and his adventures with his master.An important story element about midway through that the cat never figures out, but my wife did - it is an exchange, not a loss. This will make more sense after you've finished the book.One does not have to be Jewish or a scholar to appreciate the story and humor, but we gave a copy to our Rabbi as a gift and he loved it too. A couple more gift copies are planned too. Is that a positive endorsement or what?Parents of small children be warned - you might want to edit out the use of one bad word and some discussions of sexual topics.

review/summary: This is the most wonderful, charming Jewish book to come out in the last ten years.
review/text: What can I say? The cat is one of the most charming, insightful, and funny characters to appear since Philip Roth's more audacious characters. This book is both laugh-out-loud funny, sad, sardonic, and ultimately life-affirming. It is an extremely offbeat book - trying to describe it is almost impossible. You really have to see it to "get" it. Unfortunately, no preview pages appear on the site, because that would greatly help to convey the character of the book.To give you an idea: in the first section, the cat eats a parrot and gains the power of speech. He explores all of the things one can do with that: taunt, lie, blaspheme, and bait. The rabbi wants to teach him Torah, but he wants to learn Kabalah. The issue is brought to "the rabbi's rabbi," where the cat informs him that:"I want to convert to Judaism. He asks me why.I tell him that if I am a good Jew, the rabbi will let me spend time with his daughter.I explain to him that the rabbi's daughter is my mistress.That I can't live without her, because she is my joy, and love is a beautiful thing.He tells me that my motives for converting to Judaism are unsatisfactory, that my love of God isn't sincere.I never said anything about love of God....He says that thinking of God fills even the grayest days with sunlight. He says that the love of God should be almost carnal. He tells me that it is an intellectual love but you should always feel as though you were cradled in the arms of a master who is invincible, benevolent, and just.I tell him that this is exactly what I feel for my mistress. ...I answer that he blasphemes, that my mistress is true.He says that only God is true.I say that God is a reassuring myth. I say that he doesn't have anyone to take care of him because he is old and his parents are dead.I say that I have my mistress and I will never be alone because I will die before she does. He throws my master and me out."Couple dialog like this with the wonderful drawings, the cat's flashing green naughty eyes, the gentle rabbi and his beloved daughter, and you have an amazingly odd, touching, and engaging book.Be advised: this is not a children's book (although if you are liberal with your older children and don't mind them dealing with some adult themes, I'm sure a lot would love it). The themes are theology, faith, death, existential fear, love, religion versus secularity, jealousy, and even class differences in France. Don't be put off though; it's an easy, fun, and quick read. Sfar is immensely talented, and the sparse prose has been carefully thought out and apparently translates well. Don't miss this one!

review/summary: Blessed are those who transgress
review/text: This book works on many different levels. I feel that the main theme of this work is summed up in one panel, when the rabbi says, "Blessed are thou, who allows us to transgress."There is an underlying theme of bitterness in this book; the rabbi is widowed; the cat wants to become a bar-mitzvah, Paris has changed the rabbi's family, and the wonderful singer can only find work as a clown.The main story is that of a cat narrating the events in the lives of his owners, a rabbi and his daughter. When the cat eats a parrot, he gains the power of speech, only to lose it when he wants to break one of the ten commandments.There is a lot of religious details the author has provided, but for some reason he left out one rabbinic tradition, that of a wife cutting her hair when she marries.Another theme is the role ignorance of Kabbalah and Talmud play in religious circles.In summary, this book is a wonderful tale, but not meant for kids, due to some of the translated language.

review/summary: Like Issac Bashevis Singer - with pictures!
review/text: I stumbled upon this book while browsing in the world of graphic novels, where I rarely venture. They usually give me headaches, but this one revealed a quirky style and a refreshing lack of onomatopoeia in starbursts. It's so much easier to tell a good story when you're not constantly being interrupted by POW!! and ZOK!!! and the like.As a cat owner, I confess that it was the title that grabbed my attention, but I'm guessing that the plurality of cat lovers will not like the way the cat is drawn: Sfar's style sometimes reminds me a bit of Ralph Steadman's, and the cat's proportions change according to his mood and the context of the scene. Sfar focuses on intriguing details--a character might be drawn very sketchily in one scene, but some small object in the background will be meticulously rendered. In the next scene, the same character will fill the frame and be drawn with equal attention. This style works out perfectly for as mutable a creature as a cat.Format and style aside, the story is what really made me buy this book. The prose works just as it should with the illustrations, an aspect that I think some graphic novelists overwork, or ignore. As a fan of Issac Bashevis Singer, I was sucked in when the rabbi's initial response to his talking cat was "Will he be a Jew?" And, more importantly, "Will he be a good Jew?" (Not being Jewish, by the way, has not been an obstacle to enjoying the work of either author.)The book is divided into three separate stories, and while the first was my favorite, I also enjoyed following the cat and his rabbi as their family circle expanded to include an exotic friend with a lion (who gets along amiably with the cat) and a down-on-his-luck singer who has been reduced to belting out bawdy numbers on Sabbat.Like the very popular "Persepolis", this book has shown that graphic novels can be both funny and deep, and that they deserve to share shelves with the best non-graphic novels of our time.

review/text: I passed over The Rabbi's Cat repeatedly in the graphic novel section of my bookstore... the cover was a bit of a turn-off and the size is a bit cumbersome. I finally flipped through it at my library and checked it out. I'm beating myself up now for not reading this sooner! What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now. The Rabbi even has a debate with his cat over Western-vs.Eastern thought (albiet regarding religion and philosophy). Its a much needed return to rich storytelling in comics.

review/summary: Humorous and profound
review/text: "The Rabbi's Cat" is a sometimes humorous, sometimes profound graphic novel about an unworldly rabbi, his daughter Zlabya and her cat in early 20th century Algeria, as told by the cat. The cat gains the ability to speak by swallowing the family parrot, an act that he, of course, immediately denies. The conversations between the cat, the rabbi, and the "rabbi's rabbi" are some of the funniest parts of the book, but along with such questions as whether the cat should be considered Jewish or whether his age (for bar mitzvah purposes) should be calculated in human or "cat" years, is some serious and wide-ranging philosophical and theological discussion. What is a Jew? What does it mean to be created "in God's image"? What is the difference between the cat's feeling for his mistress and the love of God? As a Reconstructionist I like the idea put forward by another reviewer of this being "the first Reconstructionist cat." And what other branch of Judaism would a cat choose?Eventually the cat pronounces the sacred name of God and loses his ability to speak, and from this point the book concentrates more on the relationships between human beings, although still from the cat's perspective. He experiences the pangs of jealousy when a young rabbi from an assimilated French family comes to their town and falls in love with his young mistress . He and his master then travel with the young couple to Paris to meet the groom's family, and must adjust to a very different kind of Jewish life before they return home to Algeria. On their journey they encounter several delightful minor characters, from the rabbi's cousin Malkah of the Lions (and his pet lion) to a cabaret singer in Paris.The Rabbi's Cat can be read on several different levels - as an entertaining "talking animal" story, an affectionate portrait of Sephardic Jewish culture, or a complicated story of human (and animal-human) relationships. Caution to parents: This book contains brief nudity and some mature language and themes.

review/summary: A Masterpiece! Meet the first reconstructionist cat and rabbi from Algeria
review/text: Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history? He is the first writer, I believe, to have a street-smart house cat answer this question. Rabbi Daniel S. Brenner, Director, Center for Multifaith Education, Auburn Theological Seminary, NYC.

review/text: The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs.

review/summary: The Cat's Meow
review/text: Bad pun, I know, but perfectly apt for this wonderful book. "The Rabbi's Cat" is a graphic novel set in Algeria in the mid 1930s. A poor rabbi lives with his lovely daughter Zlabya and their precocious gray cat. In over 850 marvelously-varied panels, author Joann Sfar tells the story of the trio as they deal with the cosmic questions of life, love, God's existence and fickle human nature. The story shuttles between sun-baked traditional North Africa and rain-drenched, cosmopolitan Paris. Sfar's palette ranges from the reds, oranges and yellows of the rabbi's home country to the muted blues, greens and whites of the Moroccan night and of the Parisian day.The book's characters are wonderful and complex. The old rabbi is kind, God-fearing and gentle, but fears being replaced by a more urban man who speaks French. His beautiful, young daughter, content to remain in her father's house, playing the piano and reading, also longs for love. The cat -- a cunning and shameless atheistic and opportunist -- gains speech, insists on being Bar Mitzvah and demands to learn the Kabala. He contends pointedly, if ignorantly, with the learned over theological questions -- all the while angling for a night on the prowl. There's also old and sinewy Malka of the Lions, striding manfully from the desert, toting an ancient rifle and accompanied by his faithful leonine companion. The book follows the characters through normal life events -- shopping, praying for the dead, washing dishes -- but touches on themes of death, hypocrisy, apostasy and man's relationship with a rather enigmatic and silent God. Using this humble cast, and in a medium not fully taken seriously by all, Sfar plumbs depths not normally plumbed by many serious works. Sfar's art is deceptively spare, but is always evocative and never dull. His message is one of optimism, delivered with humor and humanity.If this book were a film, I would rate it PG-13 for a small amount of nudity and vulgarity, and for the adult themes it explores.

review/summary: Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat's eyes
review/text: "The Rabbi's Cat," by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.

review/summary: Too Aimless for My Taste
review/text: I've long been a fan of the graphic novel, and I picked this one up mainly on the strength of its Algerian setting. Parents should take note: despite its somewhat children's bookish cover and title, this book is definitely intended for an older audience (there are some four-letter words and nudity), and the somewhat rambling narrative may well not hold the attention of teens.The story starts in colonial Algiers sometime in the 1930s, where we meet a humble widowed Algerian rabbi, his beautiful daughter, and their scrawny cat. The first third of the book concerns itself mainly with the rabbi and the cat, who, after eating a parrot, gains the ability to speak. Before long, the cat wants to learn about Judaism and convert, and starts asking all kinds of thorny theological questions. This leads to a pretty funny debate with the rabbi's mentor -- all of does a nice job of capturing the disputative nature of Judaism. (Those with a background in Judaism may well get a lot more richness and texture from this storyline than non-Jews like me.)This promising storyline is abandoned when the cat loses its power of speech, and the middle section segues into a somewhat meandering account of the rabbi's need to pass a French test in order to remain rabbi and a visit by the rabbi's dashing rural cousin. While this does a reasonable job of depicting the indignities of colonialism, there's not much else to this section. The arrival of a thoroughly urbane young rabbi from Paris propels the final third, as the beautiful daughter falls in love with, and marries him. The married couple and Algerian rabbi then visit the husband's family in Paris (with the cat tagging along). There, the rabbi has trouble coping with the cultural differences, and goes on a little adventure to track down a musician nephew, leading to even further indignities.I can't say I found the book nearly as delightful as most others seem to. Despite the running theme of faith, the narrative is altogether too disjointed to my taste, and despite bursts of jollity, the entire tone seemed rather wistful. The artwork is similarly impressionistic, with forms ranging from realistic to exaggerated to surreal. The palate is quite nice, as the natural earth tones of Algeria contrast vividly with the oppressive dreary grays and blacks of Paris. At times the panels get a little crowded by text though, and the entire book is a bit 'wordier" than your average graphic novel

review/summary: Unpleasant and disappointing
review/text: This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and "show" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!

review/summary: Self-Serving Message
review/text: This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.

review/summary: Jean Hill's Eye-Witness Story
review/text: Jean Hill saw President Kennedy shot and she believed that at least one of the shooters was on the grassy knoll behind the fence and she estimated that between 4 and 6 shots were fired. Her story was heavily disputed by first the Secret Service who kept her in custody for hours on that fateful day, the CIA agent who was present in her first meeting with the FBI, and the FBI who interviewed her extensively for days after the assassination, as well as the Warren Commission's attorney who humiliated and intimidated her before taking her testimony for the Warren Commission.Some of the most interesting facts presented in this book are:1. Jean Hill saw Jack Ruby run at break-neck speed from the Texas Book Depository to the fence on the grassy knoll immediately after the shooting of JFK, as she ran towards the fence where she thought the shooter was.2. She saw a man in a Dallas-police uniform holding a rifle and standing behind the fence on the grassy knoll, immediately after the shooting, right before she was grabbed and escorted away by two Secret Service men.3. Her boyfriend was J.B. Marshall, the Dallas police officer who was on a motorcycle to the left rear of the president's car and who's helmet and bike got splattered with JFK's blood and brains. He told her that LBJ's Secret Service people instructed the motorcycle cops at the Dallas airport that these changes were being made: (a) the parade route was being changed to cut through Dealey Plaza on Elm Street; (b) the motorcycle cops would not be at the front of the presidential limousine as they normally would have been, but would only be at the rear of the presidential limousine; (c) the order of the cars in the motorcade was changed so that Johnson's car would not be immediately behind the presidential car, but that a carload of Secret Service would be in between the President's car and LBJ's car. Most shocking of all, was his report to Jean Hill that another motorcycle cop witnessed that LBJ started ducking down in his car at least 30 to 40 seconds before the first shots were fired.4. Arlen Specter, who questioned her in Dallas for the Warren Commission, was the one who proposed the &quot;single bullet theory&quot; that was adopted by the Warren Commission. His butchered transcript of her testimony to the Warren Commission was &quot;heavily edited, completely distorted and shamelessly fabricated.&quot;Author Bill Sloan does a credible job of telling Jean Hill's story and explaining her inner turmoil and emotional trauma about being a witness to the assassination. He explains about:1. Why she refused to go to Washington to testify before the Warren Commission.2. That she was romantically involved with a married man at the time (J.B. Marshall) and how he repeatedly tried to convince her to keep quiet about what she knew, and how he evidently knew more than he wanted to tell her.3. That the FBI kept her home under surveillance for 15 months after the assassination.4. Why she would not testify in the trial of Clay Shaw in New Orleans, although J.B. Marshall and Mary Moorman did.5. Her eventual vindication and validation through experiences with Bill Marrs (author of Crossfire) who introduced her to others who witnessed the assassination, and her experiences with Oliver Stone and Kevin Cossner during the filming of the movie &quot;JFK.&quot;6. The details of the attempts on her life (most significantly, one almost-fatal car wreck caused by the steering-wheel bolts being unscrewed and another time when her car's brake-fluid line was found to be cut).The most inexplicable fact about Jean Hill's story is why was Jack Ruby running at break-neck speed towards the shooter behind the fence on the grassy knoll? She did not know who Jack Ruby was until she saw him on tv, as he shot Oswald. Her fear that no one would believe her about seeing Ruby running towards one of the shooters was increased when she was told by FBI agent Shanklin that eye witnesses had proved that Ruby was not at Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Perhaps her identification of Ruby at Dealey Plaza is the clue to why her testimony was distorted by the Warren Commission, why she was intimidated and humiliated, and why her story is so important. No doubt, historians, researchers, and future generations interested in finding out the truth about the JFK assassination will be grateful that Jean Hill's story is finally available in this book, published twenty-nine years after the assassination, without any distortion by those who would have preferred that it had never been told.

review/summary: So Jean Hill is no John Dean
review/text: Just some thoughts on Jean Hill and her book.The only book I've purchased and read so far regarding the JFK assassination that gives you an insight on how (in this case) one of the witnesses life was affected by being in Dealy Plaza on that fateful day.She like most of the witnesses in Dealy Plaza said that she thought the shots came from the 'Grassy knoll'. She was man handled by so-called 'secret agents' 'Magic bullet man' also grilled her about her affair with a Dallas motorcycle Cop. He also goaded her about the `White dog she saw' which turned out to be White toy given to Jackie.Jean and her young daughter were involved in a car crash, her Lover and a mechanic friend of his checked out the car and found that the track rod ends had come loose. They like any mechanical minded person came to the conclusion that the car had been tampered with. Track rod ends just don't come loose so easily, if they did cars by necessity would have radically different steering assemblies.If you believe as I do that the witnesses in the Plaza were correct in their recollections of where the shots came from and also in their contact with (according to the official report NON EXISTANT) Dallas cops and Federal \ secret officials just minutes after the tragedy, then there must have been a conspiracy.Some reviewers have described this book as nothing more than a novel, so I looked up the words definition in the 'Collins English dictionary'Novel: An extended work in prose, either fictitious or partly so.I see, it's a novel because some reviewers disagree with Jeans recollections or because her recollections changed over the years. SO WHAT. Most peoples recollections of their life experiences change over the years, does this mean all our memories can only be fit for a Novel rather than a autobiography No.Now to why I titled this 'So Jean Hill is no John Dean' (I could have replaced John Dean with Harold Weisberg or Cyril Wecht)During the Watergate scandal John Dean being Nixons Legal counsel was set up for a big fall however because he had a photographic memory he could recall incidents and conversations in great detail without wavering under cross examination he deflected the blame to Nixon's Front line and eventually to Nixon himself.Most of us (including Jean) haven't got that type of memory or fortitude.Jean Hill passed away in 2000, she was a primary school teacher. Whenever her young students asked her to tell her story of the assassination, which in their young eyes was a part of American social history, she was always struck by their reactions.Her story will have left an indelible memory on a good percentage of them. I am sure some of the students will continue the search for the truth.Jean Hill was just an ordinary mother and schoolteacher.Arlen Specter is a Senator & highflying lawyer.Only one of them is a great American in my book: Jean Hill R.I.P.

review/text: The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill's side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms. Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up. I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November. Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up.

review/text: This was such and interesting book to read. It's about the one person who was the closest witness to the assassination of President Kennedy and how she was persecuted and finally redeemed. Namely Jean Hill. Her story needed to be told. It can't be ignored. She was filmed for Oliver Stone's movie titled JFK. She was cut from the theater production, but it is in the director's cut, which is the one you should see. It chronicles what lengths people will go to silence a dissenting witness. If you have ever seen the Zapruder film of the assassination, then you have seen Jean Hill. She was the woman standing on the curb in a red dress at the "moment".

review/summary: Read like a novel...
review/text: I'm a very open-minded person and I believe there was a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination. But this book only does more to discredit conspiracy theorists because it is poorly documented and reads like a novel. Probably 80% of the book is verbatim, quoted material from 30 years ago. Page after page of dialogue is quoted when all is needed is a careful summary of each exchange Ms. Hill had with various persons. It is hard to believe Ms. Hill could have remember in detail every conversation she had with every person she met over 30 years ago. I don't believe it. I think great liberty is taken in creating an interesting story but putting aside believability. It would be a good novel -- but this is bad reseach. I am impartial to Ms. Hill's story -- I think she probably saw a third gunman.

review/summary: Jean Hill has co-written a highly embellished account.
review/text: Several years ago, I wrote a 35-page article questioning the credibility of Jean Hill by comparing her statements about the assassination from Nov. 22, 1963 onwards, with the allegations made in her book. I started out as a strong believer in what Jean had to say, until I gradually realized that she was adding more and more details to what she originally described to news and tv reporters shortly after the tragedy in Dallas, culminating in a completely different account of her experience as described in CROSSFIRE by Jim Marrs. But even earlier in remarks made to author Tony Summers, there were signs of altered recollections. I got to meet Jean at the 1991 Dallas conference and two years later at a conference held in Sudbury, Ontario, where she told me to my face that I was &quot;a thorn in her side&quot;. Well, I'm sorry she feels that way, even though she hadn't actually read my article (which numerous researchers have either bought or received from me, free of charge.) I still believe that there was a conspiracy involved in the assassination of JFK, but I feel that Jean's book is far more fiction than fact (there are no footnotes), and reads like a dimestore mystery novel. Thank goodness plans to dramatize it as a television docudrama feel through. It's too bad Oliver Stone chose to use her altered account in his film. Anyone who decides to read this book, or has already done so, should consider reading my article (&quot;Jean Hill - The Lady In Red&quot;) too. As Kevin Costner said in &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;It's up to you.&quot;

review/text: Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the "little dog" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!

review/summary: The Dust Jacket Is All You Need To Read In Order To Know This Book Is Full Of Pure Bunk!
review/text: "JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness", published in 1992, was co-authored by Jean Hill, the famous "lady in the red raincoat" who witnessed the last seconds of President John Kennedy's life as Lee Harvey Oswald was firing three rifle shots at the President from the Texas School Book Depository in downtown Dallas, Texas, which resulted in JFK's death.Within this book is the following passage....."Hill saw the shadowy figure of a man fire at President Kennedy from behind a picket fence atop the now-famous grassy knoll."Anyone who owns a lot of archival TV footage of those four bleak days following JFK's assassination in November of 1963 will easily be able to verify what I have verified via just such an archive of video material. And that is the fact that, on November 22nd, 1963 (the exact day of the event, within less than two hours of the assassination itself), Jean Hill appeared on television (via a WBAP-TV tape-recorded interview), where she explicitly says she never saw anyone firing any weapon at the President. .......QUESTION: "Did you see the person who fired the weapon?"JEAN HILL: "No, I didn't see any person fire the weapon."QUESTION: "You only heard it?"JEAN HILL: "I only heard it."What is a person to make of this flip-flop in Hill's testimony regarding the events of 11-22-63? In my view, her EARLIEST account of the shooting (which has been recorded on videotape for all to watch and listen to over and over again) should be looked upon as the BEST account of what she saw that Friday afternoon back in '63.But nearly thirty years later -- after having served just months earlier as an official (but uncredited) "technical adviser" to Oliver Stone during the making of Stone's 1991 film "JFK" (coincidence?) -- Hill came out with this book, which claims she "saw a man fire at President Kennedy from the grassy knoll".Did Jean's memory suddenly improve greatly in the intervening years? Everyone reading this publication should at least pause for a few moments to consider that question.Another major piece of Jean Hill-created "evidence" that is easily knocked down is her ridiculous claim of having seen Oswald's murderer, Jack Ruby, racing across the grassy knoll at the exact time of JFK's assassination.Multiple witnesses can place Jack Ruby in the Dallas Morning News building at the precise time the President was being murdered. Ruby HIMSELF, in fact, admits to having been in the DMN building at the time of the assassination.Below is a portion of the verbatim testimony given by Jack Ruby to the Warren Commission on June 7th, 1964 (from the Dallas County Jail, where Ruby was being held after having been convicted on March 14, 1964, of murdering JFK's assassin, Lee Oswald):----------"I picked up the brochure that Friday morning {November 22, 1963}, and I also had business at the {Dallas Morning} News Building on Friday, because that is the start of the weekend, which is very lucrative, the weekend."So I went down there Friday morning to Tony Zoppi's office, and they said he went to New Orleans for a couple of days. I picked up the brochure. I believe I got downtown there at 10:30 or 11 o'clock that morning. And I took the brochure and then went into the main room where we compose our ads. That is the sales room where we placed our ads. And I remained there for a while. I started to write the copy of my ad."Well, John Newnam comes in, and evidently he took it for granted I finished my ad, and I don't recall if he paid for his ad, and suddenly there is some milling around. I think it was 12, or 15 minutes after 12, I don't recall what, but John Newnam said someone had been shot. And I am sorry, I got carried away. It is the first time I got carried away, because I had been under pressure. And someone else came running over and he said a Secret Service man was shot, or something to that effect. And I am here in the middle with John Newnam, because Newnam isn't paying any attention to anyone else, and there is a lot of going back and forth. So someone must have made a statement that Governor Connally was shot. I don't recall what was said. And I was in a state of hysteria."----------Therefore, how is it even remotely possible for Jean Hill to have seen Jack Ruby on the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza at 12:30 PM when President Kennedy was being shot? Quite obviously, this is not possible.But Jean Hill and Oliver Stone (in his movie) would like to have people believe that Ruby was running around Dealey Plaza's grassy slopes at 12:30 PM on November 22, instead of where even Ruby himself admits he was at the time of the assassination (with gobs of witnesses to verify his story) -- and that's on the second floor of the Dallas Morning News building.Since this book came out in 1992, Jean Hill has passed away. She died in Dallas on November 7, 2000, at the age of 69.---------------------This book's subject matter can get you to thinking about other eyewitness accounts of the events in Dallas' Dealey Plaza (and the shooting of police officer J.D. Tippit in nearby Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, a mere 45 minutes after President Kennedy was gunned down).I'm guessing that in a conspiracy theorist's fantasy world the only people with bad eyesight, or the only people capable of making an error, are those witnesses who gave testimony damning to "Saint Oswald" -- E.G.: Howard Brennan, Domingo Benavides, Helen Markham, Ted Callaway, Jack Tatum, Virginia Davis, Barbara Davis, William Scoggins, Johnny Brewer, Warren Reynolds, L.J. Lewis, Pat Patterson, Harold Russell, Robert Edwards, Ronald Fischer, etc.But, if we're to believe the "CTers", those conspiracy-favoring witnesses like Jean Hill and S.M. Holland and Acquilla Clemmons, et al, were somehow born with unimpeachable "Conspiracy-Noticing" skills.Acquilla Clemmons' account of the J.D. Tippit murder is taken as Gospel by many a-CTer, despite the wholly-ILLOGICAL "plot" that she supposedly witnessed on Tenth Street that day.....I.E.:Having TWO killers conspire to commit the Tippit murder, even though the conspirators' #1 goal here is to FRAME JUST ONE SINGLE "PATSY" FOR THIS MURDER (namely someone called "Lee Harvey Oswald").Smart, huh?Let's use TWO killers (needlessly, of course, for a practically point-blank killing of a policeman, who was just inches from the gun of the killer), instead of just using our trusty, present-at-every-murder-Oswald-supposedly-ever-committed-in-his-life "LHO Imposter" to do the job.From what school for covert acts did these plotters graduate -- "The Academy For Brain-Dead Conspirators"?Nobody could be as stupid and reckless as these November 22nd Plotters/Conspirators were said to have been (per CT-slanted versions of events). Not possible. And this recklessness extends far beyond just the Tippit murder scene as well. In fact, it applies ever more so to the JFK killing in Dealey Plaza.Example:WHY in the world would these professional killers even WANT to utilize THREE teams of assassins (as Oliver Stone claims in his movie), firing six bullets potentially into their one target (JFK) from a variety of different shooting locations, when the whole idea of this intricate, supposedly-well-planned "plot" is to frame just a single "Patsy" who is supposed to be located in the Book Depository? Did these conspirators deliberately TRY to make their assassination scheme as complicated and implausible as they possibly could? Seems like it.And yet Oliver Stone actually has people buying this stuff. Kinda sad, huh? I think so anyway.Well, anyhow, whatever you do, take the contents of this book with a very large-sized grain of salt. (That advice goes double, make that triple, for viewers of Oliver Stone's motion picture as well.)

Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book.

review/text: John Malatich: the man, the philosophy, the legend. Perhaps only two of the three will suffice to describe this author his magnum opus: "The Theory of Everything is...". Unintentionally bizaare, Mr. Malatich expresses his philosophy in swarms of capital letters and misplaced parentheses that invite the reader to vainly delve deeper into the text to find the hidden meanings that are simply not there. Unlike the Codex Sepentarius or the Voynich Manuscript, this work does not use its own script; however, like those two, the inscrutbility of text and alien drawings lend an otherworldly note to the text.Though I'm giving this book a 3/5, do not think that I'm endorsing Mr. Malatich's ideas, as I find them puerile and easily refutable by even the untrained eye. However, taken as a sort of 'art' , this book stands as a brazen testament to the American kook: those who willingly and unabashedly ignore reality in preference to living within its confines.

review/summary: Kudos for Kay...I finally saw her human side!
review/text: Patricia Cornwell has finally added that element to Dr. Kay Scarpetta's character that shows her to be a human with emotions, fears, and self-doubt. Dr. Scarpetta leaves her Superwoman cape behind in this novel as she does battle with her long time foe Temple Gault. Temple moves his murderous spree to New York City where he decides that his Christmas gift to the Big Apple (and Kay Scarpetta) will be to leave a dead, bald, unidentified homeless woman in the bowels of Central Park. He then sends messages through CAIN (the very computer system created to catch him) to taunt Kay and the FBI. He does a masterful job at eluding the police and the FBI - even going so far as to kill right under their noses. But even the most masterful of murderers has a weakness, and in this gripping novel light is shed on what, in the end, brings down the house that Temple built

review/summary: Unsatisfying ending disappoints the reader
review/text: The plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending. It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book. A superhuman villian was terminated too easily. The method of capture was not adequately developed. Several promising themes were not followed up by the author, especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault's uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation. The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner

review/summary: Un libro veramente tosto
review/text: La recensione la scrivo in italiano, anche se il libro l'ho letto in inglese (perche' non volevo aspettare che arrivasse in italiano &quot;Il cimitero dei senza nome&quot;).E' un libro ben scritto pieno di suspence e che si legge tutto d'un fiato.Secondo me e' uno dei migliori (se non il migliore) che Patricia Cornwell abbia scritto.Ovviamente lo consiglio a tutti, anche se e' preferibile che leggiate prima gli altri che lei ha scritto, visto che i personaggi si evolvono nel corso dei vari romanzi.Dicono che ne faranno anche un film...non vedo l'ora che esca nelle sale italiane.Ciao a tutti.

She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det.

review/text: Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story

review/text: This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth

review/summary: You have GOT to be kidding
review/text: This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists.

review/summary: My first and last Patricia Cornwell book
review/text: I actually tried another PC book a few months ago (don't remember which one) but gave up in disgust with all of the advertising I found in it - references to AOL, Reebok and The Body shop.But I saw this book in the library and seeing as she is so popular decided to give her another chance. Big mistake. The characters in this book were wooden and the main character, Kay Scarpetta is laughable. When it is discovered that the killer on the scene knows where she lives, she blubbers about having to leave her house and car. Now here's a heroine we can get behind!!I read about 200 pages before giving up. I decided I had wasted enough of my life on this drivel. I had read in other reviews that there was one good scene in this book. I didn't get that far because I didn't find one in those 200 pages.I followed this book with &quot;Denial&quot; by Peter James and saw the difference between the insipid rubbish that Cornwell passes off as a thriller and the real thing.&quot;Denial&quot; kept me turning the pages until the end.

review/summary: This book is BAD!
review/text: I read &quot;Postmortem&quot;a few years ago and remember enjoying it, so I figured I'd give another Cornwell book a chance.It was a mistake.Cornwell's prose is about as sophisticated as a 40-ounce bottle of Colt 45. I know one doesn't read this kind of novel for its beautiful language, but prose on a higher level than sixth grade composition class shouldn't be out of the question either. I can count the number of metaphors used in this book on one hand, without extending any of my fingers.And the plot is...well...lame. Had it been anything other than boring, senseless tripe I would be able to overlook the complete lack of artistic craft in the book. But it wasn't.The antagonist is a drug addict, who is &quot;decompensating,&quot; yet he still manages to break into a high-security computer system in the FBI building, all the while committing murders in public places while eluding scores of policeman like the invisible man. This book would be better classified as science fiction than crime fiction.What a stinker!

review/summary: Disappointment at it's extreme
review/text: I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope. I have too many other good books to read before I pick up another book from this author.

review/summary: More of a &quot;yawn&quot; than a &quot;scream&quot;, really...
review/text: Usually I read &quot;general fiction&quot;, but I also like to read &quot;crime novels&quot; from time to time. Of course that good &quot;crime novels&quot; also qualify as literature. Take Graham Greene, for instance, or James Ellroy, the Tinseltown Dostoyevsky. Of course that it's a very tricky business, that of writing crime novels. And unfortunately, Ms. Cornwell's &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; falls a little bellow the mark.Let's take the character development, for instance. Or rather, let us not take it, since there isn't any. Scarpetta continues to be a paranoid b***h who simply cannot stop moralising for a second (I like strong women characters; unfortunately, this one is just irritating). Lucy, whose very existence should be considered a crime, manages to be more annoying than Jar Jar Binks. Gault barely manages to be ONE-dimensional, let alone be terrifying (he's about as scary as Dr.Evil from &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Minus the jokes.) Marino is his usual amusing cardboard self and everyone else is just walking backdrop.But let us forget character for a while. How about the plot? After all, a good plot can save a crime novel, can't it? Well, not always, but in this case there is no plot. None that Cornwell hasn't written before, that is. Think about it: someone is out on a killing spree, Scarpetta takes on the case, Scarpetta goes here and there and finally, some name is pulled out of the filofax and thrown into the page, only to have him/her shot dead (usually by Scarpetta) at the end. The only difference here is that this time we *know* who the killer is, so the plot becomes quite obvious after the first twenty pages! Not that there weren't enough intriguing possibilities around: say, what has the Army got to do with everything? Or who exactly is Gault's father? (It would be interesting if Cornwell did a &quot;Chinatown&quot; here - you know: the scene where Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) reveals who is the father of her daugther - and came up with some really nasty solution to the question of Gault's parentage. Instead, it appears that Peyton Gault's brother was shagging his wife - duh!) But unfortunately, none of this leads anywhere. The &quot;plot&quot; merely goes on undeterred in its path towards Trite-city, Predictable-land. The only thing that starts out by being vaguely arousing is the scene where Scarpetta meets the Gaults. We aren't usually treated to this kind of viewpoint in the over-simplistic Scarpetta novels, so my hopes were high. What a major disappointment, considering that that scene is handled with all the subtlety of a demolition ball wrecking a building. I know that scenes like that are very difficult to write, but surely Cornwell could have come up with something better? After some time I came to realise that the purpose of that scene was to remind us how much &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; was brilliant in its handling of the reactions of parents towards their wayward - or their lost - children.Also, since we are talking about Scarpetta meets the Gaults, let us pose a question: why, pray tell, is there no explanation concerning Gault's fixation on Scarpetta? And consider the following situation: two twin siblings, very similar genetic traits, very similar upbringing... so why was Jayne Gault such an angel and Temple Gault such a demon? Should we start calling for father Merrin here? (OK, so he snorts about six lines of coke a day, but so did Drew Barrymore before her reinvention and never was she seen indulging in a killing spree.) Also, if it was so obvious from such an early age that Temple Gault had some serious problems, why didn't his parents commit him to an institution? Did they hope that he would grow out of it? In a word, Conrwell's tidbits concerning Gault are pure and simply bizarre. It's so ironic that I re-read the brilliant &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; by Patricia Highsmith before I picked up &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; - what a glaring contrast. Gault the classical Anti-christ? Compared to the wonderfully textured Tom Ripley he is just a complete ninny.There were some other things that left some bitter aftertaste in my mouth, such as the ever-present pro-death penalty stance (alright, Patricia, we know what your opinion is... enough already, OK?) and characters being fans of Ayn Rand's books (eek!!!). But considering the former, doesn't Cornwell know that the US is the only industrialised Western country to still have the death penalty? (Here in Portugal we got rid of that *in the late 1800s*.) Doesn't she realise that her arguments either mean absolutely nothing to the other countries where this is being sold or simply irritate lots of people there (myself included)? Also, why does Cornwell insist in portraying Scarpetta &amp; mates as defenders of a featureless society against criminals that are portrayed as &quot;complete outsiders&quot;? Is she afraid to face the real texture of a corrupt society, such as in &quot;Seven&quot;, for instance, and deal with the underlying problems? Since crime has been a feature of almost all human societies from the dawn of time, how about devoting some pages to that issue, instead of brushing it under the carpet?But I see this is getting too long, and I believe that I have stated the reasons to why &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; was a complete waste of time and money. If you want to read an interesting crime novel - a *real* novel - from the female perspective, read &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot;. If you insist in reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; go ahead, but don't say you haven't been warned. As for me, this was not the first Cornwell novel I read, but it will certainly be the last.

review/summary: Do we Finally See the End of Temple Gault?
review/text: I read a lot of the reveiws, and I don't agree with quite a few of them. I thought this book was pretty good, and exciting. Yes, the plot is a little thinner than previous books, and yes Kay does wear on one after a time, but the forensics are awesome, and the suspense keeps on and on. I do have to admit that I do tire of Lucy somewhat. To me the books would be better without that added character. In this book Kay, Marino and Wesley are on the trail of the infamous Temple Gault (Kay's long time nemesis). The story is set around the week from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, but a lot happens in that short time. We see Kay, Marino and Wesley panicking as they try to nail down what seems to be the most notorious serial killer in the country at that time. Pretty good stuff!

review/text: Like the reviewer from Nova Scotia, this was my first Patricia Cornwell novel. I found myself liking the characters, especially Kay Scarpetta, and the plot's good, as is the writing. But I felt that it was a bit like arriving half way through a party. Everyone seemed to know each other and I had a bit of catching up to do (since it was my first time). It was also quite detailed, and I found myself looking back to pick things up. Perhaps I didn't read it quickly enough. But on the other hand that might have been because it wasn't quite as absorbing as it might have been.I'll try another Cornwell book in a few weeks and see how I feel.

review/text: Patricia Cornwell did it again. This is the best of hers that I have read so far. It only took me two days to read the entire book, which usually says a lot for me.It will be a bit hard to really say much about the story without giving anything away, but let's just say Temple Gault is at it again and he is worse than you have ever imagined. If you do not know who Temple Gault is, he is a serial killer that was introduced in the last two books, Cruel and Unusual and The Body Farm. You will want to read those before you jump into From Potter's Field.

review/text: Don't let the first quarter of this book discourage you. I thought it was slow, cliched and I almost ditched it, and would leave it in my handbag to read on the train to work if I was really bored. But as I kept reading it on train, I realized eventually, I could not put it down; I had to know what would happen next, as with all good mysteries. I ended up reading it not only on the train but through the night at home, I just had to know what happended! Great mystery and the main character, the Medical Examiner, Scapetta, (which is very important when I read a book) is someone with credibility and that you care about what happens to.

review/summary: Not very much depth or substance to this one
review/text: The house we stayed in for New Years had a ton of books on its shelves and since it was raining a lot we had plenty of time to read. I picked up this book New Years Eve and finished it New Year's Day. I chose it for a couple of reasons, first off I had just finished a historical book and it was time for something light and I had recently seen a 20/20 episode where Patricia Cornwell claimed to have solved the identity of Jack the Ripper. So I was intrigued. I like mystery and thrillers and I knew she had written a lot of books in the genre and my wife had read several of hers and liked them. First off I must say that Patricia was stretching the word per page ratio with this book. I was reading the hard cover edition and the margins were very wide and each paged ended like 3 inches from the bottom with some silly footer taking up a lot of space. Secondly and partially as a consequence it was a very fast read. Finally I would not recommend this book, but it was entertaining in some regards. I don't know about any of her other novel's (I think I will check out one more of her's as a fair shake, in particular there was one book that one a bunch of awards one year that looks promising) but I found this to be a weak example of the genre. Lets face it, in any genre there are real works of literature that are the top of that particular genre, say Tolkien in fantasy, I am not sure what is the supreme literary example of mysteries but whatever it may be this was a bland consume. I didn't really care for it much. It is basically your typical psycho serial killer vs. the "law enforcement" individual. In this case Cornwell's hero is a heroine, Kay Scarpetta and Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia, for which I think she has earned a lot of interest. However for a thriller of this type I enjoy James Patterson's Alex Cross series much better.

review/summary: The devil in the detail
review/text: I'm not a fan of the crime writing genre, so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel. Unfortunately, I cannot speak highly of From Potter's Field.I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine, so it makes me suspicious of the novel's factual integrity when I read that a murderer's eyes are &quot;as pale blue as a malamute's&quot;, when in fact (according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America), a malamute's eyes MUST be brown, never blue.It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies (and the media!!) in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country's highest profile serial killer. Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star.

Just as Cornwell has Dr Kay Scarpetta, Heron pens the Adele Monsarrat series.

review/summary: Why Patricia Why?????
review/text: I again gave this a four rating. I enjoyed most of the book. It will hold your attention and you wonder what is going to happen next. Temple Brooks Gault comes to the surface again, this time in New York. But, he shows up many different places. You expect him to walk into Dr. Scarpetta's office at any moment. As usual Captain Pete Marino is in rare form. My only problem is the adulty Dr. Scarpetta continues to commit with FBI Agent Wesley. I still think it cheapens the character of Scarpetta. I think of her as honest and upright. In fact,on page 281 she even had this to say,&quot; I will do more than threaten if people don't do the right thing.&quot; Then she goes to bed with a married man with children. Go figure.

review/text: Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea.

I also found a alot of typos in this book. usually just minor ones but a name was completely wrong, but correct in the very next sentence. I had to stop for a second and think....who is that? ok...off to Amazon.com to find the next one.

review/summary: Meeting the Parents of a Serial Killer
review/text: Another great book from Madame Medical Investigator Author Patricia Cornwell. Always well-researched, this time the book causes Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Marino and of course, FBI Agent Benton Wesley to investigate the death of a frozen naked woman propped openly in Central Park. Their path leads them to the parents of a psychotic serial killer, one of whom can see nothing wrong about her son and the other parent who would only see his if pointing a shotgun at the son's face. The woman's identity is a shock, as is Scarpetta's handiness with a side-arm. A must-read!

review/summary: Cornwell does it again, and again, and again, and again...
review/text: ...and with this book, she has done it yet again.The book does not start off too well, with the sherrif Santa bit being a bit confusing for the first couple of pages. I didn't like it. And i thought i might be in for a disappointing Cornwellian offering.My, was i WRONG.This book is yet another stunner. She has definitely veered away from the cunningness and cleverness which inhabited her first three books. But she more than makes up for it with a chilling plot and one of the most cold and clinical serial killers i have eve read of. Essentially, this is a serial killer novel, and as that it not especially original. But it is nonetheless a good one.Marino, Benton, Lucy and of course Kay are back again for another great read. Cornwell's writing is sharp and to the point, and keeps the you turning those pages. I can't really put my finger on a reason why, but from the first time i read a Cornwell book i feel in love with the way she writes. It's simply...wonderful. I can't get enough of it. It's no more literate than the next person's, but for some reason i just relish every sentence she writes.The plot here is sometimes scatty and random (as was Cruel and Unusual) but here, she pulls it off a lot better. I tend not to like books full of random killings, without rhyme or reason (yoo hoo, James Patterson, author of Violets are Blue, i'm talking in particular about you.), but here i really did. The randomness is chilling, and Tenple Gault is a super villain, who curdles the blood. He is just so...hateable. You loathe him absolutely. Especially when you find out how he treats his sister. You just hate him even more. With every part of i wanted him to die, die, die. It is hard to conceieve of anyone so cruel and horrifically terrifying than him. When Scarpetta talks to his parents, it's painful to read, even though it's fiction. It's an extremely moving scene, full of emotion. (As is the entire book.)This book moves along relentlessly to it's absolutely brilliant conclusion. It is the best conclusion she has penned yet, down in the bowels of the New York subway. Dark and frightening, she really brings over the atmosphere.I loved this book, as i have loved almost every single Scarpetta novel so far.The identity of the first victim should come as a real shock.

review/summary: The Life of the Chief Medical Examiner?
review/text: I am currently taking a murder mystery class at my college. I have not read many murder mysteries before this class. We have read a variety of novels for this class, with the most number of novels by one author being three. The one Patricia Cornwell novel our class read is "From Potter's Field." I very much enjoyed this novel, though I think it should be considered a thriller instead of a murder mystery. The novel also had some hard to believe aspects about it, which were difficult for the members of my class to look beyond.Why should this novel be labeled a thriller and not a murder mystery? Well, the reader clearly knows who the murder is. Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the Chief Medical Examiner, has the feeling the murderer is her "nemesis," Temple Gault with plenty of reason. The only mysteries are for her to prove Gault is the murder, identify the first body of the girl, "Jane" and of course to find Gault, before he finds her. A thriller is also more appropriate because it had several moments that were extremely suspenseful, the kind that makes the hairs on your neck stand up. There is a section of the novel where there is a murder in Kay's office building and she believes the killer is still in the building. As she walks around the building, you expect Gault to jump out at any moment. There is also another section in which a trap is set for Gault in NYC's subway system. Not knowing whether or not he'll show up had me on the edge of my proverbial seat.As much as I liked this novel, there were several things that irked me about it. A Chief Medical Examiner seems more like an office, administrative position than a really, REALLY hands on job. Kay almost takes on the role of a detective. I could almost believe her occasional tasks of doing autopsies, but to travel to see a suspect's family seems over the top. Cornwell tried to combine too many types of people into just one character. Kay is the Chief Medical Examiner, technician, administrator, loving aunt and family member (sister and daughter), mistress, detective, seemingly EVERYONE'S friend, CIA/FBI associate, and still has time to be the nemesis of a serial killer. How the woman has time to eat is beyond me. Cornwell also did not take the time to really develop Kay as a character. It is far more difficult for a writer to show you what someone is like opposed to telling you information. Cornwell clearly is a teller, hence the really wordy and winded sections of the novel. This writing style is not as affective in writing a believable novel.I did find a unique aspect of the novel for me, personally. I'm from NYC and grew up there. I really could visualize the sections of the novel that described Central Park, the Museum of Natural History and the subway area at the end. It just added a realistic element to the novel that initially bought my interest in it.Overall, the novel's plot flowed for me, even with the occasional extremely unrealistic sections and poor writing. The ending was a big let down for me, but decide for yourself. If you're looking for a thriller with entertaining potential, give this Cornwell novel a try.

review/summary: Very Dissapointing
review/text: From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel.

review/text: This was the first Scarpetta Novel I read. I was half way through the first chapter when I went back to the store and bought all the books in the series that came before. This is the best there has been. This book delves into the mind of a sadistic killer, Temple Gault. It can not get more terrifying than starring into his dead ice blue eyes. If you are into thrillers this is one that will keep you up all night and not just reading. Guaranteed to make you jump at any sound.

review/summary: Good but incomplete
review/text: "Cruel and Unusual" was my first Scarpetta book, and when I looked on the jacket of "From Potter's Field" and saw that it would deal with Temple Gault again, I decided to read it next, hoping to see this killer get what he deserves.Most of this book was pretty engrossing, even though I did have some gripes. Kay's affair with Benton is disappointing to me since she seems to pride herself on "doing the right thing." Lucy was insufferable in this one. She was younger in "Cruel and Unusual" and I could overlook her idiosyncracies, but she's older now and needs to get a grip - she almost seems to resent or dislike Kay at times but then turns around and loves her again. Also, Lucy's genius IQ and role as an FBI computer program writer who busts crime with her keyboard are beyond corny.The best part IMO was the scene in the morgue, as others have said. I don't think I would have been able to put the book down if a tornado had ripped through my house while I was reading that part!It is difficult to believe that a crazy guy high on cocaine most of the time could always be one step ahead of the police and FBI, brutally murdering people right under their noses and getting away with it.But then the worst came. The ending. Wham, bam, it's over, with Temple Gault's fate implied but none of the juicy details I was hungering for. There wasn't even a page break - one second we're in the subway tunnels of New York, the next we're flying over Potter's Field. Huh?

review/text: Kay Scarpetta seems to be a very unhappy person at times, but she does get involved in some dandy murder mysteries--and this book is one the best in the series!Temple Gault is still on the loose, focusing this time on Kay and her niece, Lucy. Temple likes to kill just for the thrill of it and never leaves any clues.He centers in now on Kay Scarpetta, and it is up to her to stop him in matter what.This book defines "thriller" and I could not put it down - especially the scene late one night in the morgue. What happens? Read and find out. You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Hey! Wait a minute!
review/text: I really enjoyed this story and the writing very much -- until I got to the end. The events that bring us to the climax are intriguing and shocking (and grisly, as a warning to anyone not familiar with Cornwell). The interpersonal relationships among the &quot;good guys&quot; -- Kay, Benton, Marino, Janet and Lucy -- added texture and enhanced the suspense. And I enjoyed moving from Virginia to New York to Hilton Head with Kay. BUT this ending! So much action brings us to a very unsatisfying climax. Throughout the book, we hear at least two characters muse as to why the villain behaves as he does. This made me want to hear a definitive answer. And we never get it. The book ends so abruptly, you would think Ms. Cornwell simply ran out of paper.

review/text: I really enjoy Patricia Cornwells books and this is no exception.Even though it deals with a character previously written about it does not stop you from understanding.I really like the descriptive nature of her books even though I don`t know some of the terms I enjoy learning about them.The book is compelling and fastmoving even if it is sometimes gory. It is unputdownable and the concepts within it are believable.An excellent and exciting read.

review/summary: She's Done Better
review/text: Having read six of Cornwell's novels I have to say that this isn't presented with the momentum and irony that her other books had. The first fourth of the book is excellent, but then the ending is so disappointing that you wonder why she even bothered with the foreshadowing. I enjoyed this book, but it could have been better.

review/summary: An Engrossing and Chilling Read
review/text: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the &quot;evil&quot; Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give &quot;gifts&quot; to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say, I will be reading more of Cornwell's books, especially if they are at all like this novel.

I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell develops.....Marino's gruff demeanor and language are so colorful...Dr. Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her down...The development of Lucy's character is interesting, but it is time she, too, develop into a stronger person emotionally. Cornwell's work is, for me, as good as Grisham's.

review/text: I enjoyed it very much particularly the written skills in describing the characters and the crime scenes. However, I was not convinced about the ending since it did not explain about why Temple Gault was challenging Dr.Scarpetta. Perhaps a book on his adolescent and how he develops an emotional attachment to Kay would be interesting.

review/summary: One of the best of its kind!
review/text: This is only my second Cornwell novel, and I have already been won over. From Potter's Field was even better than Body Farm, and it was nice to get to know the characters even better this time around. My only criticism is that I'd like to see more likeable characters. So many of them are hard-edged or not very warm, which is also true of Dr. Kay, though I do like that she is a strong, capable woman. Unlike others, I don't see Kay's affair with Wesley as some moral affront. While I don't say it's right, it is part of real life, and it helps to show Kay's softer, more vulnerable side. The buildup to the climax was nail-biting. More, more, more! :)

review/summary: The BEST of times...the worst of times
review/text: Let's get the negative out of the way right away: On the &quot;worst&quot; side, like many, I am weary of Lucy and her neuroses, and VERY weary of Kay's unhealthy (not to mention adulterous) affair with Benton Wesley. A waste of pages, if you ask me. BUT, I appreciate that Kay Scarpetta is not &quot;larger than life,&quot; and therefore more believable. On the &quot;BEST&quot; side, I could not put Potter's Field down--literally! It was a one-shot, four-hour read! It would have been a three-hour, and even more gripping read, if the above-mentioned &quot;worse&quot; were removed--are you listening Patricia?--but as an author of suspense/mystery, especially where the details of forensic science are concerned, Cornwell can't be beat!

review/summary: The Manhattan Sanction
review/text: This 1996 book starts on a cold and snowy Christmas Eve; Santa Claus is handing out presents on an urban reservation. Suddenly there is a shooting, and a night forever silent for an intruder. ME Scarpetta has another customer for the morgue. Afterwards they learn that a serial killer has struck again in New York. Scarpetta and Captain Marino are then summoned from Richmond to work with the FBI.This book gets up to speed in the first pages, unlike a Hammett or Chandler. The author also tells more of the personal life of the fictional heroine, and her faults. Times have changed.A known serial killer is operating in NYC, and is stalking the police who are searching for him! Quite a change from the usual story. [Is this believable?] The computer used to track killings has a virus in it; this mirrors the real-life serial killer. Scarpetta's niece is involved with this computer system, and is searching for the virus. [Could someone just out of college be hired for this seemingly important job?] The serial killer then plays games in the morgue!Scarpetta locates the serial killer's parents, and learns how they wire money to one location. A trap is set but the serial killer at first eludes it. But in the last pages the killer is found and eliminated. The book moves as fast as an action movie.

review/summary: Good Enough
review/text: I have read almost all of Patricia Cornwell's series with Kay Scarpetta and if you liked her other books, you will probably enjoy this book as well. It has the same feel as the others except I find the adultery that Kay continues to commit inconsistent with her strict sense of right and wrong. Marino is always a great character you can easily picture in your mind and I found the scene with the police at the morgue particularly good. The ending was a bit of a let down. However, I'm still hooked and will continue to read her books.

review/summary: Overwritten and underdeveloped
review/text: I like the idea. I like strong women characters. And I like mysteries, suspense, and crime stories. But I don't like Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta stories. It's very hard to differentiate between her characters, and the &quot;surprise ending&quot; leaves the reader feeling cheated, as there is no development leading up to the conclusion. One feels as if one has read a several hundred page prologue to a short story. Instead of character development, we are treated to the condition of the women character's breasts (perky, upright, sagging, fat) and just how much the male characters smoke.The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is hugely judgemental, frighteningly paranoid, and irritatingly egotistical. The story grinds to a halt here and there as Kay spouts off yet another moralizing homily about the right to privacy (except when SHE needs information), the right to own an arsenal of weapons, and the right to sleep with someone else's husband. Oh, and the right to be unbearable after giving up smoking. (For one painted as such a sterling genius, the whole smoking emphasis suffuses the book with an overtone of cognitive dissonance.)The idea is interesting. The sketch of characters is interesting. Patricia Cornwell needs to get out the way and let the story flow.

review/summary: &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; is one of Cornwell's best!
review/text: I recently got hooked on Patricia Cornwell's series of novels featuring Kay Scarpetta, and I thought &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; was excellent. The plot was terrific, and the characters are so real. After reading the book you feel like you know them. Cornwell also does a great job of making the crimes and detailed as possible. And her evil character Temple Gault is one of the most frightening fictional characters I've ever come across. My advice is that you definitely read this book, but only if you've read at least one of the previous novels so that you're familiar with Gault, and several of the incidents that play a part in this story line.

review/summary: Forensic thriller!!!
review/text: Christmas Eve in Central Park--Temple Brooks Gault stands over his latest victim, washing his bloody hands in the snow. Pleased with his new kill, he lifts the heavy steel of an emergency exit and disappears into the fetid tunnels of the New York subway system.In Richmond, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, chief medical examiner of Virginia and consultant for the FBI, is in the midst of a late-night autopsy at the morgue when the call comes: Gault, the sadistic psycopath who has eluded capture for years, has struck again. For Scarpetta, her worst nightmare returns.She and longtime FBI and police collegues Benton Wesley and Captain Pete Marino fly to the eerie early-morning scene, where they immediately recognize Gault's grizzly handiwork. But no seems to know his bald female victim, who's naked body has been propped up against a frozen fountain. It makes no sense that she apparently disrobed in the bitter cold without a struggle and walked barefoot over snow to her death.While Scarpetta sorts through strange forensic evidence, including an uncommon thread pattern and extremely rare gold dental restorations, Gault kills again. But the prey he ultimately seeks is Scarpetta for it becomes inscreasingly apparent that he is as focused on her as she is on him. It may be possible that he kills to impress her, and that he's trying to get at her through her young niece, Lucy, who is the brains behind CAIN, the worldwide FBI computer network.Throughout what proses to be Scarpetta's most frightening chase,she can almost sense the evil, electrical presence of her nemesis. But when she draws close, he slips back into the darkness, waiting for the time when at last they meet...

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: This was the sixth of Ms. Cornwell's Dr. Scarpetta series I've read. I'm glad I started with &quot;All That Remains&quot;, and not this book. Come on I know how she feels being involved with a married man, but I don't wish to be reminded of all the negative possessive, crazy, feelings that take over your mind. I like her acknowledgement in &quot;The Body Farm&quot; that this was not morally right, but that it felt too good to stop. I enjoyed her interactions with people much better in her earlier Dr. Scarpetta works than in this one. While the mystery is still fast paced and has you holding your breath, the interpersonal relations suck. I read to find a relief from having to deal daily with this type of people. Ms. Cornwell has the right idea to get you to identify with Kay, but I had a hard time feeling comfortable identifying with Kay in this book. I've been stressed out, &quot;b***hy&quot;, and &quot;crazied&quot;, over life and men, but I don't read to be reminded of those unpleasant aspects of life and people. My advise to Ms. Cornwell is to have Dr. Scarpetta to &quot;get a grip&quot;. Deal with life and have fun, don't get lost in the small things. I also have enjoyed the interplay of Kay's relationship with Benton Wesley much more than with Mark James. I like the idea that Benton is a completion of Kay, a ying to her yang. I wish I knew more men like him who can stand up to a strong-willed, intelligent professional woman and make her a more whole person. I hope Ms. Cornwell will &quot;fix&quot; Kay in her next book, and flesh out a happy relationship between her and Benton (less negative thoughts, more enjoyment and smooth working between the two), and &quot;fix&quot; Lucy too-its ok if she has an alternative lifestyle if you want, but if you don't want her to be happy in this fashion, find her a boyfriend, not another girlfriend(!!!). I agree with the comments from her next book on Lucy, stop beating a dead horse with Lucy, make her a semi-functional character, or get rid of ! her. In closing, this series on Dr. Scarpetta is a refreshing type of mystery that keeps you on your toes and looking over your shoulder for the killer. I throughly enjoy her style of writing and would recommend her previous books to anyone. However, this book was a grave disappointment, I had come to expect a cool strong-willed, compentent, Dr. Scarpetta, and all I found was a decompensating shell of her former self. If you've read her earlier books you may want to steer away from this one. I found myself greiving for Kay and Ms. Cornwell after finishing this book. Come on lets find the old Kay who has character and stamina to have a great mystery adventure.

review/summary: Gault's Back...
review/text: It is Christmas Eve and all is not well. Kay and Marino are called to New York where there is a dead body waiting on them in Central Park. As in the last book, the scene is staged in the fashion of serial killer, Temple Gault. The body is unidentified and the identity of the body was one I had not expected. The book also continues with Lucy and the break in at the FBI from Body Farm. I like the Kay Scarpetta series and have been reading from the beginning. This book is probably best enjoyed if you have read her two previous novels, Cruel and Unusual and Body Farm.

review/summary: gripping
review/text: There's a crazy killer on the loose and the sicko loves the attention he is getting from Dr Kay Scarpetta. Scarpetta travels to New York City and Hilton Head Island in this thriller. The sicko also teases her with some visits to Richmond, and even uses her credit card. I found this to be an above average Patricia Cornwell book. Lots of action, lots of autopsy detail... very entertaining. The only part I found odd was the army connection.

review/summary: The Definition of a Thriller!
review/text: In FROM POTTERS FIELD, Temple Gault is back and he's at his worst (which is great news for the reader!). This psychopath is Kay Scarpetta's nemesis and New York is his home turf, which puts her at a definite disadvantage. Gault leaves special clues knowing Scarpetta will know it's his calling card and lure her closer to his trap for her. She knows she's in his web and he's drawing her ever closer but she is not able to stay away, for doing so would keep him free to increase his fatality rate.This has to be my favorite Patricia Cornwell book. I loved the game of cat and mouse that Gault plays with Scarpetta. I loved the way Scarpetta plays the game determined to win no matter what Gault tries to throw at her. And I especially loved the gift of the scalpel and the chase through the subway tunnels all over New York City (I can't say anymore without giving away too much!).This book is constant action with no slowing down so the reader can catch his/her breath. It's almost as if the same cat and mouse game being played between Scarpetta and Gault is being copied between Cornwell and the reader. I found myself "reading just one more chapter" so I could figure it all out and Cornwell keeping those answers just a few pages out of my reach. Oh sure, she'd dangle a carrot to tease me, a little morsel to keep me going, but kept me chasing the answers until the end!If you want a book that will help you relax before you go to bed or a book that will leave you with a feeling that all is wonderful in the world, pick up a book of poetry because this is definitely not the book for you. If you don't mind losing some sleep and want to be catapulted on a journey that is unforgettable, then pick up a copy of FROM POTTERS FIELD today! This story is the definition of a "thriller". Definitely a "stop light book" in my opinion. (If you would like know what I mean by a stop light book, please see my review on Ugly Duckling by Iris Johansen.)

review/summary: Entertaining, but one major quibble.
review/text: I listened to the tape version, which is pretty good for getting you to the beach, etc. There is a strong narrative drive that carries you along. However, having the text read to you highlights some of the lack of &quot;tightness&quot; that good editing could have fixed. Also, please don't TELL us that Gault is the worst murderer of the century, SHOW us. Prove it! My personal quibble is that when our heroine is talking with a woman's father and he asks if his daughter is dead, Kay answers with a flat yes, when at most she's got a hunch as to the identity of the dead woman. This is inconceivable for a forensic pathologist whose specialty is not only what she knows, but what she can prove. I'd probably listen to another Scarpetta book on tape, if I got it from the library.

review/summary: From Potter's field, buried with no name
review/text: Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell.

review/text: This is my favorite Cornwell story and it will leave you a little spooked. This was my first exposure to Patricia Cornwell which lead me to many of her other books. Temple Gault is an exceptional villain and the development of his character leaves you know how he looks, feels but no always what he may be thinking. Chillingly effective! Well worth reading.

review/text: The first 90% of the story held my interest. In the last 50 pages it seemed that Miss Cornwell ran out of steam. It had a let's-get-this-done anti-climatic aire. I expected a thrilling pursuit through the subways of New York, complete with frustrating near misses and near successes. Instead, we get bad guy just comes straight to the heroine, temporarily captures heroine #2, is thwarted by heroine and disabled, all in 20 or so pages.

review/summary: A Thrilling Novel by the Master
review/text: Patricia Cornwell's books are nothing short of a master-piece, especially the novel, From Potter's Field. I could not put the book down. Following Dr. Kay Scarpetta through the tremendous search of finding the identity of a young women who's body was found naked and frozen in Central Park. Then finding out the actual identity of the woman and her relationship with the killer was amazing. Patricia Cornwell's books always have the best, most intreguing characters. For example, the physco-pathic killer, Gault, was such a master-mind at what he did. The way you read a book, not being able to sit still with untameable anticipation of what will happen next, is the way every Patricia Cornwell's books will make you feel. I would recommend this book to anyone! :-)

review/summary: Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability
review/text: This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read. She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story.

review/summary: A good murder mystery.
review/text: Upon finding the dead, unidentified body of a woman in Central Park, Kay Scarpetta immedialtely recognizes the gruesome work of Temple Gault. Temple Gault has been murdering people for many years. He hasn't struck for a while, and everyone, including Kay Scarpetta, dreads the horrid day when he does. Kay Scarpetta is the chief medical examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI.When they find this unidentified body, they know immedidately that it is a Gault killing......for only he murders and them puts the victim in a sitting position. This time Kay and her team are determined to find and kill Gault, no matter what the cost. But this time is different, Gault seems to be chasing Kay and her computer expert niece Lucy. Lucy, however, tries to beat him at his own game. She tries to trap him on the computer long enough so that they can find out where Gault is located.From Potter's Field, by, Patricia Cornwell, starts out pretty slow, but soon reaches the action part and takes off from there. It is a very well written, chilling and suspenseful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat.I really enjoyed this book not only because it was well written, but because it was a mystery. If you like mysteries and semi-horrifying books, I suggest that you read this book.

review/summary: Gault at Fault
review/text: Did you ever read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand? Few people have, because it's long and it's dull, something about Rand's philosophy of man against society seen through the eyes of John Gault.Now Ayn Rand ends up in Inspector Penn's bookcase and Temple Gault ends up with a scalpel in his thigh, riding the rails, so to speak.Usually, authors describe villains who we come to dislike. Cornwell's villain, this coke-snorting psychopath, ends up surrounded by all the forces known to man, in New York City anyway. The FBI, the city police, the transit police, you name it. I ended up rooting for the guy to escape, that's how repelled I was by Cornwell's climax, or was it an anti-climax? Was it nothing more than a severed femoral artery?I did learn something from this book: the subways in New York are confusing and homeless people can sleep there. Oh, and I learned that computers have evolved a lot since this book was written.So to sum up, I don't know which book was more boring, this one or Atlas Shrugged, but neither one is really worth reading, I'd say. Diximus.

review/summary: Stereotypical characters kill the book
review/text: Cornwell does have somewhat interesting story lines and the ME aspect is definitely interesting. However, any momentum the book hopes to attain is thwarted time and time again by her stereotypical characters. Why does every man have to be a one-dimensional macho idiot who can't believe that a woman can hold such a serious job? Does Cornwell truly believe that men are like this? Meanwhile, Scarpetta and her niece Lucy are depicted as physically fit, attractive geniuses who eagerly whip up a seven course Italian dinner after working a 16 hour day, everyday. I forgot to mention they are rich and always level-headed with never an 'off' day. Essentially these characters have no challenges left except for contrived (mostly relationship) problems. Scarpetta ponders being perfect while not being loved or able to let herself love another. Well, if she didn't love herself so much that would be a first step. She's definitely egocentric. Lucy would be as egocentric, but alas, she is humbled through her worship to her shrine - Scarpetta. Lucy was almost challenged with alcoholism but thankfully that challenge ended after a few months (yet another narrow escape from character development). Lucy also has a hard time with relationships and can't seem to find that right person who complements her intellect and beauty on an even level. To wit, it's lonely at the top. Being perfect is attainable - 1) love yourself first, 2) stay single, 3) proceed with a monastic life of studying all day and night, 4) learn to cook. And remember: what being over-worked, grossly over-sensitive, and self absorbed don't do for your heart and social life they make up for in your bank account and your bloated sense of self-importance.

review/summary: No characters, no plot
review/text: This depressingly inept novel is devoid of interesting characters and the plot is so ludicrous that only curiosity about how much worse it can get keeps one reading to the end. And Cornwell does not disappoint--it gets worse and worse and worse, until a conclusion that is as contrived and pointless as any in fiction. Another reviewer on Amazon called this book drivel, but that was perhaps too kind an assessment. This is the lamest book I have ever read.Each character is assigned one trait--Marino is bigoted, Lucy is angry, Benton is beleaguered--with the exception of the star of the show, Kay Scarpetta, who seems to have drawn two traits--stupidity and a major shopping addiction (dropping brand names is her hobby).A brief list of plot sillinesses: can you believe that the FBI would not know the most basic facts about &quot;the nation's most wanted serial killer&quot;--that he has a twin sister and a famous uncle?; can you believe that the FBI would set up an elaborate trap using NYC subways because they could not risk a shootout? (why not just arrest him as he leaves his apartment building, once they have found that?); can you believe that a trained law enforcement person would leave her gun lying around as many times as the dimwit heroine does in this book?Worse than this are the many things that Cornwell throws in that end up having no role in the book--a sick mother in Florida, a subplot abpout her sidekick's love life, her niece's lesbian romances.This book is all filler, no substance. They must be paying her by the word. The real mystery is why Cornwell has recidivist readers.

review/summary: Thanks Patricia Cornwell!
review/text: Thanks to Patricia Cornwell! Before reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; I was afraid that I couldn't make it as a professional writer. But now I know that if she can sell books, so can I.With the build-up this writer has received, I expected a better read. The first person narration makes Dr. Scarpetta sound like an egotist. A character who is always right like our good doctor needs someone besides herself to narrate her exploits. Sherlock Holmes would be an insufferable boor had his creator not had the sense to tell us of his superiority through the eyes of faithful Dr. Watson. How many times can you use the word &quot;I&quot; in a 412 page book? How about using the third person, Ms. Cornwell? Then we'd know what characters other than Dr. Scarpetta are thinking.Another gripe--too much information. Ms. Cornwell substitutes technical jargon and unneeded facts for solid characterization and plot. And I realize this may seem picayune, but does the writer, her editor or her proofreader use spell check? The hard-cover book has a number of spelling and grammar errors--amazing!If you are a fledgling writer like me and want a little motivation to begin submitting queries for manuscripts, read this book--you'll find encouragement here! If you are a reader in search of quality fiction, you might want to keep looking...

review/text: I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it.

review/text: Does anybody really believe that when a joint FBI/police/medical examiner team needs to locate West Coast dental specialists quickly, they would decide the best way is TO SPAM EVERY USER ON PRODIGY asking for a knowledgable dentist to contact them?This book has so many problems, I hardly know where to start. They fall into two main areas -- no, not the print and the page, the pages, at least, are innocent! There are editorial problems, and problems inherent in a story that reads as if it didn't have the author's full attention.Let's begin with the editorial problems. Do you believe that sirens can &quot;whelp&quot; through the sky? (and is that why we say it's raining cats and dogs? or at least, puppies?)Dialogue moves in and out of a &quot;no contractions&quot; zone, which has the characters suddenly using formal diction -- maybe ONE character in modern America could get away with this, but most of them? How often do senior cops and med. examiners, in casual conversation, say &quot;I will not&quot; and &quot;I do not&quot; instead of &quot;I won't&quot; or &quot;I don't&quot;? It's the unevenness that is jolting and extremely irritating, as if there were multiple editors, one of whom didn't believe in contractions while the others did.But the editors can't be blamed for the plot problems and general stupidity of the characters. How many times are we expected to believe that people who are told every other sentence that they should not go out alone have yet again gone out alone? One second they're talking about putting Scarpetta into the Federal Witness Protection scheme and the next, she's going into work 2 hours early so she'll have the whole building to yourself -- does anybody think the readers will be surprised when You Know Who intrudes on Scarpetta's early-morning solitude? It happens repeatedly. It's like a B-grade horror movie -- the characters are idiots who walk stupidly into danger they could easily avoid. But then there'd be no book (not necessarily a bad thing).The main character's resemblance to Superman pales quickly. In a crime scene, only Scarpetta will spot the incriminating footprint. In a crowd scene, only Scarpetta will spot the suspect in the crowd. Why bother with all the other police/FBI/NY Transit Police?Even so, Scarpetta doesn't detect much, she mostly intuits. If more than one person could have done something, you can bet that Scarpetta knows which one did it. How? She just knows. Maybe the rest of the team doesn't know whether the killer is in Virginia or NY, but Scarpetta does. Why? She just knows. If one character has a high-ranking uncle, and she hears that another is vaguely rumored to be related to someone important, you can bet that she'll guess the two are siblings, and she'll be right, and the reader will not get any more explanation. As a reader, I feel cheated -- where is the detection? If I wanted to read about clairvoyance, I'd be reading books in a different genre.The ONE redeeming feature is the scene in which Scarpetta meets the parents of the serial killer. That jumps off the page. What is it like to have your child turn out to be a monster? How would you react? Cornwell should have developed this, made it the focus of the book, have Scarpetta skillfully tease useful information from the parents, DO SOME DETECTION, instead of having her charging around with an arsenal, hopping planes and FBI 'copters all over the East Coast until you, the reader, feel the jet lag.If Cornwell can write that scene, why did she write 400 pages of drivel to wrap around it? I know that she's a well-known, well-respected author, but she was really asleep at the wheel for this one.I only wish Amazon would let you give a book ZERO stars.

review/summary: The first, and probably last, PC novel I ever read...
review/text: I borrowed this book from a co worker while I was abroad, and regreted it ever since, because it was even worse than having nothing to read at all... There were 2 things that ruined my enjoyment of this book:1) the main reason was that the plot, and Kay's actions, were totally illogical - someone who is afraid of a murderer stalking her would be more careful than Kay was, for instance... Unlike what I'd expect from a professional dective, Kay Scarfetta doesn't use logic but follows her intuitions, which don't seem to be based on anything but her vague feelings that it must be saw, and each and every one of those feelings turn out to be true... That doesn't make the book very believavle...2) when an author writes a more than one novel wuth the same main character, you could casually pick up of of the books in the middle of the 'series', or even the last book of it, and have a pretty good idea of what's going on, even though you'd have a much broader outlook of things if you read the previous books in the series. But not only does PC use Kay Scarffeta as her main character in numerous books, but she brings Temple Brooks Gault, the villain, back from the past, without giving a thorough background of his and Kay's history, just a little line saying Gault has some things to resent about the detective... And so on... This is just one examples of past characters and occurances that are mentioned in this book that occured or were introduced in the past, and there are so many of them that it really makes the book very vague and gives you a feeling you don't understand even half of it without having read the previous books. This might be OK for fans of the author but it doesn't make casual readers, like me, want to research enough to get the prior books and read them....

review/summary: Scarpetta vs. Gault!!! The one you've been waiting for!
review/text: I was heavily anticipating reading this book after finishing The Body Farm i pick this one up straight away and started reading it. Right from the prologue i was hooked i couldnt put it down. I read through this book quicker than any of the other Scarpetta novels.It is interesting to see how Kay started off owning just one gun in the first novel, a Ruger .38. And now she has an entire arsenal in her garage.Temple Gault is definatly the most well known of the Scarpetta villans, he is a pure evil killing machine. Although he never actually appears in the book for long periods of time there is always that sence of danger, that he might be around soemwhere, and that he is capable of everything. That is what's so intimidating about him.Overall Scarpetta has created a classic here, itll keep you hooked right up until the climax when Scapetta finally goes head to head with Gault in a deadly battle of wills that will have you on the edge of your seat in excitment.Well doen Miss Cornwell!!!

I read 1/3 of the book and threw it in the &quot;yard sale&quot; pile. It's the first book of hers I've read and I don't intend to pick up a second one. This is really a prime example of bad writing churned out for non-readers and quick profits.

review/summary: Plodding to Potter's Field
review/text: I'm reading the Scarpetta books in order, starting with All That Remains. (My library does not have the first two in the series.) From Potter's Field was a big disappointment. I loved it at first. It begins with Kay and Marino working Sheriff Santa's route through bad parts of Richmond. It isn't a Merry Christmas for these poor folks, and it becomes miserable for Kay when she's called to NYC. Temple Gault has struck again, and he's as brutal as ever.Gault just can't leave Kay alone. He's attacking everyone who is near (and sometimes dear) to her, including her niece and the top-secret computer program.And I wanted to care throughout this book. And I tried to care. But, when I got to the part where Marino, Lucy, and Janet were playing security in Kay's house, I had to stop. I was bored with the story. I read some spoilers on here, and decided to read the last two pages for myself. ::yawn::There are not just one or two important subplots, but about 50 gazillion thrown in to the mix. In addition to several murders, there's Frances and her team, Apollonia, Carrie, James, etc.Kay is still a complete snob. What's worse is that she is still carrying on her affair with the married guy. That causes unnecessary drama. I don't pity her bad choices in men.I'd say skip this book, unless you are a fan who needs to know how Temple Gault is brought down. Even then, like other reviewers have done, skip the boring parts. Get to the end. You'll be disappointed, but at least you'll know...

review/summary: My First Patricia Cornwell
review/text: Gotta say that my first Cornwell was very interesting. Her chapters were a bit long for my taste, BUT everything she writes from start to especially the finish, kept me on my toes and at the end, my heart beat very fast. I will give her a bit of a rest as I am not certain I can handle more of Ms. Scarpettta right now, but will go back for more action and long chapters very soon. Cornwell, has the knowledge of crime scene investigation better than any author I have read. She makes her heroine, a medical examiner, not a coroner, of which there is a big difference, come to life, like no author I have ever read. Just gotta take a while to digest this book. It does have me shook.

review/text: Out of all the foes Scarpetta has faced in her career Temple Gault is hands down my favorite. The way Cornwell describes him is so vivid and creepy that you can see and hear him even after you put the book down. Some great twists and turns that will give you vertigo and leave you wanting more. There are some very sad and moving parts in this book and it always surprises me how easily Cornwell can tug at your heartstrings. A beautiful read!!!

review/summary: Disappointing - Not Up to Other Books in This Series
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Scarpetta series. This book, however, is not up to the other books in this series and I was disappointed.This mystery features the same cast of characters as the other Scarpetta mysteries. However, the crazy sadist, Gault, appears to be a caricature of a person. There's one formulaic clue after another and it becomes unbelievable. The protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, is shop-worn and new characters are introduced but never developed. Marino, the politically incorrect, chain-smoking cop is the most real and endearing character in the book.Supposedly a mystery, this book drops clues from the sky, more in line with a fantasy.

review/text: The is one of Scarpetta's better adventures. Temple Brooks Gault, the serial killer released from prison in "Cruel & Unusual" plays mind games with Scarpetta and the NYPD and NY Transit Police after a woman's body is discovered in a park. The twisty plot is worth a re-read, especially for the ending which pits Gault against Scarpetta and her geniuse niece, Lucy, in the subway tunnels of New York.

review/summary: First Cornwell read, entertaining and fast paced
review/text: This was my first Cornwell book. I enjoyed the characters in this story and I look forward to reading more about Scarpetta, Marino, Benton and company. The action was fluid and I was never sure where Gault, our killer, was going to turn up next.Cornwell is detailed and this lends credibility to the plot and circumstances. The events are gruesome, but this is a coroner we are reading about, so that is to be expected. Cornwell does not exhaust the reader with gore and that made the subject matter easier to handle.The one criticism I do have is that the story moved so fast that I felt I was sometimes missing something. I think I just have to get used to Cornwell's writing style, and I maybe should have started the series in a chronological order. Nonetheless, a satisfying read, and I would recommend the Cornwell series to others, worthy of 4 stars.

review/summary: Cornwell can do better, and I know it!
review/text: I've been an ardent Patricia Cornwell fan, since I read the first of her books, Post Mortem, about two summers ago. Since then, I've been trying to get my hands on her books, in the order that she wrote them, so as to follow the character building that she's done for the Chief Medical Examiner of VA, Key Scarpetta, and her entourage including Det. Marino, Agent Wesley, and her niece Lucy.However, this book left a bad after-taste in my mouth. The story moves at a very fast pace, but then that's about the only thing that is good about this book. Rest everything is about average. Sadly, Cornwell tries to inculcate fear of Gault in the reader's mind, but nothing much seems to happen to Scarpetta anyway, despite her working in what could very well be the least secure government offices in the world! Just about anyone can break in, at anytime, anyone can make anything disappear, anyone can crack any security protocol and encrypted passwords - one seems to wonder how's the place still standing!It reminded me of those spoof teenage horror movies, where the favourite quip is "don't open that door...", or "someone was lurking in the shadows, and I was alone...". This book has one-too-many of such circumstances, and I for one found my interest wavering on each of those ocassions.Forensics is the reason I took to reading her, but this book largely lacks in Forensic Science / Investigation. No foreign material, no strange residue, no inexplicable wound mark... nothing to intrigue the reader.The climax is high-tech, but again a little lost on me.P.S.: I'm still wondering WTH does it have to do with Potter's Field?An average read: 2.5 / 5

review/text: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel.

review/text: I was interested in this book from the first page. I could not put this book down! However, there were a couple of things that bothered me. First, there were too many coincidences. It's very odd that an investigator just "happens" to come across something that is important to the case and gives him or her a clue. And this happened more than once. The other thing that bothered me was how quickly the book ended without much resolution. I could've gotten over the coincidences if only the ending didn't fall flat. It still is a good creepy read, but it isn't the best.

review/summary: Are you sure your doors are locked?
review/text: From Potter's Field begins with a murder in NYC's Central Park. The victim is a homeless woman who's body was found propped up next to a fountain. Images of previous murder victims propped up in poses flash though Kay Scarpetta's mind and she knows immediately that this murder seems to be the handy work of Temple Gault. The body count doesn't end there though as Gault leaves a trail of violence and death. Gault is getting careless and this might mean he will finally slip up enough to be caught. There are a lot of twist and turns in this book that will leave you flipping to just one more page and then another pausing just long enough to get up and make sure that your doors are locked.I have read too many horror novels to count. I've never been scared by any book except for Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. I read right before I go to sleep and there have been nights that I slept with one eye open after reading one of her books. I recommend that you read the series in order to fully understand and enjoy the books.

review/summary: It just keeps getting better!
review/text: &quot;With each book, her scalpel is getting sharper,&quot; the praise from Newsweek on the inside cover claims. After reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot;, as well as six other novels by Patricia Cornwell, I must agree with the reviewer's statement. Cornwell has yet to write a book that disappoints me--so far, each book I have read has been more thrilling and stimulating than the last! This book was no exception. In &quot;From Potter's Field&quot;, Kay Scarpetta, Lucy, Marino, and Benton Wesley return to once again match forces with Temple Gault, a notorious serial killer who first surfaced in &quot;Cruel and Unusual&quot;, the fourth book in the Scarpetta series. As usual, Cornwell's elements of obvious research, superb characterization, and plot developement were present, making the story seem very realistic. Everytime something new is introduced into the plot, it all builds up until everything comes together at the end. It was fun to reread parts of the book and figure out how it fit into the picture. Overall, just another great Cornwell book. I don't know what else I can say about it that has not already been said.

review/summary: So much potential
review/text: This book had so much potential. Cornwell crafted a great plot with this one. I agree with an earlier reviewer that there were several things that were unrealistic in this one. However, the plot was so good and the action was pretty tense, so I was willing to overlook those details.I was honestly enjoying the book. Then I came to the ending. I had read the Scarpetta series in order from Postmortem to this one. Her serial killer Gault appears in several of the prior books, and the Scarpetta vs. Gualt finale happens here. I won't give it away, but let me say I was so disappointed that I quit reading the series.The poor ending of this book, combined with the unrealistic events and general lack of research by the author in all her books has made me decide not to read anymore from Cornwell. With books I haven't read by better authors like DeMille, Deaver, Connelly, and Crais I don't want to waste my time with below average books.

After reading the previous novels and enjoying them, I must say that "From Potter's Field" ranks among three of my favourite Scarpetta novels along with "Body of Evidence" and "The Body Farm". As with every novel in the series, Patricia Cornwell's writing is crisp and entertaining, even if the ending of this book is quite silly. If you want an entertaining, gripping read, try "From Potter's Field" and every novel in the Kay Scarpetta series.

review/summary: If you enjoy a sideways and bizarre look at life and what it presents, then you will enjoy this book.
review/text: Cartoons featuring bizarre situations with a hint of truth can be either sick; funny or both. The cartoons in this book can be placed in one of these three categories. Life is always a bit bizarre, even when it is at its' most normal and routine. Somehow, each day manages to present a situation that is slightly odd, even though sometimes it is a strain to see it that way.McPherson has the perfect mentality and outlook to develop cartoons like this and he does see it that way. They are often exaggerations of the natural foibles of all aspects of life, from elementary school to retirement. There is the teacher that wants all students to contribute, so she ties ropes to their hands so that she can forcibly raise them. There is the barber who never sweeps up the hair because it insulates the floor.If you enjoy a sideways and bizarre look at life and what it presents, then you will enjoy this book.

review/summary: Funny, but not many Coloured Diagrams
review/text: I was a little disappointed with this. Though I enjoyed John's humour as always, there is a decided lack of coloured art. I remember purchasing a "Bloom County" book of cartoons back in the 1980's - and large portions of the book were in colour. But the reverse is true here. There are some illuminated sketches, but the great majority of the book is black and white. Half the fun of Mr. McPherson's work is witnessing the funny pictures, and the lack of colour interfers with this. I would like publishers, as part of the book description, to include an accounting of the amount or percentage of hued work.

review/text: This book is the BEST!!!! It's so funny when I first read it, I felt like I was going to COMPLETELY LAUGH MY HEAD OFF!! Some examples of the cartoons that are in this book are- a necklace that is made out of baby teeth, a woman who blows her face off with a hair drier, and a man who juggles at the dinner table with meatballs! So see what I mean? This book is TOTALLY HILLARIOUS!! So buy this book- NOW!

review/summary: The First Two Books Were Really Good, But....
review/text: I just finished the last book of the STARCHILD TRILOGY by Pohl and Williamson last week. I thought the first book REEFS OF SPACE was the best.Some of the things I liked about REEFS OF SPACE:The Plan Of Man - A super-computer which runs all human affairs. Citizens must constantly check-in at computer terminals for orders ie. before beginning work, after completing each task, before leaving a room, after entering a room etc.Risks - People who have performed badly, underachieved, or been caught performing unplanned actions or having unplanned thoughts.The Collar - An explosive collar worn by the Risks which can be detonated at anytime The Plan Of Man sees fit. It also explodes automatically if tampered with.The Body Bank - If a Risk continues to screw up or underachieve there is still one way he can contribute to society by providing body parts for transplanting onto or into those citizens who need them in order to remain useful to society.The JunkMan - A man built by using body parts and made to look exactly like one of the donors at The Body Bank in order to take his place so that this donor could escape, the only person ever to do so.There was some cool scientific stuff too; jetless drive, Hoyle theory, simbiotic relationships. But all that mumbo-jumbo means little to me. Just call me Olaf Simpleton because it was the simpler concepts which I found entertaining and interesting.One thing left me cold....At one point in the story someone says that they've known several people who were sent to The Body Bank, but they've never known anyone to recieve a body part from there. Nothing else was ever mentioned about that.=============================Book II=============================The first book of THE STARCHILD TRILOGY (The Reefs Of Space) I gave four stars. This book (STARCHILD) is not quite as good as the first one. I can't give it 3-1/2 stars so I'll round up and settle with giving it four stars also.In THE REEFS OF SPACE you're shown how The Plan Of Man super-computer affects and controls every aspect of daily life for the citizens of Earth and it's colonies. You also get to experience what it's like to wear The Collar and a really good tour of The Body Bank. In STARCHILD The Collar is still a big part of the story, but only brief mention is made of The Body Bank. This second book of the trilogy also gives an up close and personal view of The Plan Of Man super-computer. You get to see how it needs human extensions of itself, humans who can be completely trusted. You're shown what it takes to become a companion of the computer; the education and training involved, the surgical modifications needed, and the sacrafice of "self" and the leaving behind of all that had been a part of your previous life, including loved ones. You also get to see what it's like to live out on the reefs as free men, out of the reach of The Plan Of Man. The climactic ending is great.If you intend reading the entire trilogy I suggest you stop after this book, I could hardly finish ROGUE STAR(the third book). You DO need to read the first book(The Reefs Of Space), but I'd say the conclusion of STARCHILD is adequate enough to wrap up the series.=============================BOOK III============================This trilogy got progressively worse for me. The first book (REEFS OF SPACE) I really liked and it was my favorite, but by the time I reached the final pages of the third book (ROGUE STAR) I didn't really know where the authors were heading with it and I really didn't care.I felt they had abandoned some earlier concepts a little too early, and perhaps could have pursued and developed other story-lines further. I hate when that happens! Abandoning one really cool concept or story-line for a lame one. I couldn't buy into that "infant star has a crush on a beautiful woman" thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It ate her boyfriend and that's why it has feelings for her. Still not sold.

review/summary: Gets to the point
review/text: When I first took Financial Accounting, I was using Prentice Hall's Accounting textbook by Hongren. My prof was real anal-retentive and required us to read every chapter. To ensure this, he would quiz us on the contents of each chapter before we covered it in class. I spent so much time trying to wade through the excessive verbage in that book that I ended up not having any time left to do actual problems or sharpen up my practical skills. As a result, I ended up with a D in the class although I understood most of the concepts very well. When I took the course again over the summer, I had a different professor and he used this book. What a breath of fresh air! Meigs and company explain the accounting concepts just as thoroughly as Hongren but with about half the verbage. I breezed through my summer course and got the highest grade in the class. This book is an excellent teaching tool for beginners and would also make a great reference guide for more advanced students.

review/summary: A Good Overview to Africa & Arabia Antiquities
review/text: Childress once again gives us a survey of lost cities, this time in Africa and Arabia. He really doesn't do a lot of original research or exploration, merely interjects the findings of others. But its better than having to read all of those other books. Almost 20 years old now, maybe Childress will someday update this series. The section on Solomon is the same as I've read in at least 2 other of his books. This series is probably a guilty pleasure to scholars who aren't allowed - or would be shunned - if they explored some of these topics. Of course, maybe more scholars would pay attention to some of these interesting sites if Childress would lay off the "levitation" and "E.T." musings. I don't know what to make of his travel stories. All true? Embellished? I'd like to think that there are still people out there adventuring and maybe these books will inspire others. He did found a World Explorers Club to these ends. But for all of his travels, he sure doesn't have a lot of firsthand photos in his books.

review/summary: I hope no one takes this book seriously
review/text: A synopsis of the first chapter: around 12,000 BCE, three very powerful civilizations existed in and around the Mediterranean. Atlantis was a mini-continent in the Atlantic Ocean west of the Straight of Gibraltar. The Osirian Empire was located in the basin of what is now the Mediterranean Sea and the Rama Empire existed throughout Persia and into India. The civilizations of both Atlantis and Rama possessed flying airships, very similar to those commonly reported as modern-day UFOs. In addition, the Rama Empire had some type of laser-based weapon. They used anti-gravity technology to levitate giant cut stones weighing three million pounds into position at a site in modern-day Lebanon as a landing pad for their airships.According to Jared Diamond, a preeminent cultural anthropologist, the development of agriculture did not occur until around 11,000 BCE and was localized in the Fertile Crescent until 7,500 BCE. Since one can trace food surpluses as a requirement for the settlement of cities and subsequent development of technology in cultures all over the world, it seems unlikely, at best, that the Rama Empire possessed airships, laser weapons and anti-gravity technology before humans domesticated the pea (in 8,500 BCE). It just seems a little difficult to believe that in between hunting and gathering, people had time to construct flying ships, weaponize lasers and employ anti-gravity technology. This is especially remarkable given that it took humans 14,000 years to redevelop the technology for flight and we still haven't been able to weaponize lasers or develop anti-gravity technology.The book may appeal to people looking for an interesting read, but it should not be taken as a scholarly work. In fact, the author's attempts to cite scholarly sources and research to justify his claims are laughable. Also, there are numerous typographical errors (mostly omitted prepositions and possessives as well as punctuation errors).

review/text: How this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else.

review/summary: A very interesting historical travelogue
review/text: David Hatcher Childress' Lost Cities series has proven to be consistently interesting, and Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of Africa and Arabia is no exception. Taking the everyman approach to travel writing, Childress' accounts of his travels through Arabia and Egypt are very interesting and insightful, full of both interesting travel advice relevant to the regions he travelled through and accounts of personal experiences that make his stories very interesting to read. He thoroughly covers all of the major and most of the minor historical sites to be found throughout Africa and Arabia, often at great personal risk. It took guts to make the journeys he has made, many of which were in areas very dangerous for Americans, and a talent for writing to make them interesting. I thoroughly recommend this and all of the other Lost Cities series of books to all would-be travelers with an open mind and an interest in the unusual.

I was headed for Jordan and was interested in reading up on Petra when I found this book. As I read more, it began to get really interesting. His broad coverage of various theories of ancient civilizations is fascinating, if sometimes hard to believe. But, that being said, there are so many unexplained civilizations out there that, however fanciful the explanations may be, who knows, some may even be correct!! It's an entertaining read, and really causes you to reconsider some very basic historical facts that may turn out to be in error. How DID those guys at the Temple of Ba'al move 2 million pound stones?!? Makes you wonder!!

review/summary: A few things you should know about 'Lost Cities of Africa and Arabia'
review/text: David Hatcher Childress makes no secret of the fact that he supports the diffusionist, as opposed to the isolationist view of prehistory (i.e. he believes there was more contact between various ancient civilisations than is generally supposed by academics). Whether one swallows DHC's views on Atlantis or the 'Osirian Empire' is really beside the point, as this book's value lies primarily in its entertaining and evocative travelogue, not in any pretensions to accuracy. Even if DHC's theories are completely bogus, his books still make entertaining reading.The reviewers who dismiss DHC's books as worthless because he isn't a scientist and engages in speculation (sample sentence: "1932 was a good year for mysterious ancient roads in Kenya") are themselves remarkably clown-like in their earnest simplicity. The book provides an argument against them in the form of a great quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: "for God's sake give me a young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself!"Previous African travelogues I read include Shiva Naipaul's 'North of South' and Paul Theroux's 'Dark Star Safari', both of them sardonic, near-misanthropic works. While DHC doesn't have a literary style to match those accomplished authors, his wide-eyed optimism and childlike sense of adventure at least make an interesting contrast to the jaded cynicism of Naipaul and Theroux.As one would expect from someone who has hitchhiked through the Middle East and Africa, DHC is full of entertaining travel tales and encounters with amusing characters, like the Palestinian truck driver he gets a lift with in Jordan who makes an unexpected stop at a tent in the desert, which turns out to be a brothel, then emerges minutes later zipping his pants up, saying "no good, no good..."In Israel he is taken to hospital with gangrene, and just as he is about to be treated, finds the place is suddenly deserted. The doctors have all gone home for the sabbath, and he has to wait another two days for treatment...One part of the book that intrigued me dealt with the mysterious Tuaregs of the Ahaggar mountains in southern Algeria. Their chief town is called Tamanrasset (i.e. Taman-Ra-Set)...a survival of ancient Egyptian paganism in a remote pocket of the Islamic world? The Arabs are said to be afraid of these mountains, and many eerie and surrealistic tales are told of them.DHC's book will appeal to those who like hitchhiking travel stories, or those who like esoteric speculation (or both). I doubt it will appeal to puritanical empiricists, but there are plenty of other books they can read instead.

review/text: There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story, this isn't it. It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well.

review/summary: Lots of flavor, little facts...
review/text: Ok, let's get one thing out of the way. David Childress is not an archeologist. Some people seem to get hung up on this, so let's make that real clear. I always see his books in the &quot;Travel Narrative&quot; section of the bookstore, and that's exactly what they are... great travel narratives.The books has two modes. Mr. Childress' travel stories, and his telling of &quot;wacky&quot; theories of the places he visits. Within the first 25 pages, you have stories of ancient nuclear weapons, flying machines, and continent spanning civilizations that no one has heard of! And he explains that this is the &quot;easiest&quot; way of rationalizing the things he has seen! (Such as, giant blocks of stone that are too big to move, &quot;even by modern engineering&quot;).On the whole, this is a great read if you want some insight into the crazy ideas that exist out there. Childress seems to have a mainline into most of them. His travel writing is pretty good too.One note: the editing is terrible. Spelling and typos all over the place. The typography &amp; layout of the book do leave something to be desired.

review/text: Let's face it: this isn't a very good book. Then again, &quot;Godzilla vs. Monster Zero&quot; wasn't a very &quot;good&quot; (if we must assign labels) movie. Childress, a &quot;maverick archaeologist&quot; who seems to spend most of his time floundering around grimly impoverished Third World locales and getting nowhere with evasive women at bars, provides an insanely amusing travelogue of his journeys through the jungles and exotic landscapes of Africa and Arabia, commenting along the way on the unknown Atlantean, Lemurian, and other civilizations that flourished once upon a time and were responsible for the Pyramids, THE MAHABHARATA, and presumably Jimmy Hoffa's and D.B. Cooper's whereabouts. The most insane thing about this book is that a lot of it might be true. So far as I know, we still know very little about the Neolithic era, and the concept of &quot;lost&quot; civilizations would imaginably appeal to many readers depressed at the state of the world (including myself). However, I must agree with the other negative reviewer that Childress offers no convincing evidence to support his theories (and not very much UNconvincing evidence, either). The only sources he uses are hopelessly mossbound Victorian &quot;explorers&quot; (who knows how many African bearers' lives they may have used up to supply this book with fodder for speculation?) who had their own &quot;issues&quot; to deal with. Don't even get me started on the possible cultural-studies implications of this book. That being said, it WAS a lot of fun, and he does occasionally come up with some exciting memories and fantastical theories that NEARLY make up for my having read this book.

review/summary: 40 Years of Life; Lincoln Reconsidered fires the brain
review/text: Lincoln Reconsidered is a collection of provactive essays that probe the multiple depths of Abraham Lincoln--life and mythology. He paints Lincoln's portrait onto the background of the sectional conflict that led to the Civil War. Originally published about 1961, Donald's stories remain fresh and relevant. In fact the reader will encounter the thesis and outline for his recent prize-winning biography of Lincoln. I first encoutered LR in 1962 when I taught Advanced Placement American History and assigned portions of the book to my students. They loved it; you will. Donald is a superlative historian and stylist. Listen to these chapter headings: Getting Right With Lincoln, Reconsideration of Abolitionists, Herndon and Mrs. Lincoln, Folklore Lincoln, An Excess of Democracy. Readers of Donald's Lincoln will want to have this as a companion reference piece. It's rare for an historian's essays to experience such a rich and extended publishing history. Here's a quote from my faded copy of LR, a touch of wisdom for our parlous times: &quot;...Lincoln knew that there were limits rational human activity, and that there was no virtue in irritably seeking to perform the impossible. As President, he could only do his best to handle problems as they arose and have a patient trusdt that popular support for his solutions would be forthcoming. But the ultimate decision was beyond his, or any man's, control. 'Now at the end of three years struggle,' he said, 'the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.'&quot; Page after page runs like this, and virtually every theme connected to the Civil War gets enough discussion to stimulate and edify.

review/summary: Lincoln for our times
review/text: Lincoln Reconsidered is a series of essays written by Donald prior to the publication of his award-winning biography Lincoln. First published in 1956 and now in its third edition, the essays have worn well, providing great insight into Lincoln the man as opposed to Lincoln the myth, much in the vein of Richard N. Current's The Lincoln Nobody Knows. Had Donald accomplished nothing else this would be a valuable addition to everyone's Lincoln reference library. But the value of Donald's insights goes beyond those of Lincoln and his era. As a former Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics teacher, there is much in this slim volume that is instructive for our contemporary divided America, essays relevant and useful in today's classrooms. And insights which serve as a warning, particularly his comment that, "At only one time have rigid ideologists dominated our national government--the Sumners of the North, the Jefferson Davises of the South--and the result was near disaster." (p. 13) Let us pray in 2013 that history does not repeat itself. In more or less chronological order Donald examines: Getting Right With Lincoln, The Folklore Lincoln, Toward a Reconsideration of Abolitionists, An Excess of Democracy: The American Civil War and the Social Process, Education Defective: Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness, Herndon and Mary Lincoln, Refighting the Civil War, The Radicals and Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln and the American Pragmatic Tradition, A Whig in the White House, Reverence for the Laws: Abraham Lincoln and the Founding Fathers, and A. Lincoln, Politician. In each essay Donald challenges conventional wisdom and asks the reader to reconsider what he or she may have thought to be established fact. He also frequently confronts historiography that he considers to be biased, narrow minded, or serving an agenda. It's okay to "get right" with Lincoln in the sense of looking to Lincoln for guidance in challenging times; it's not okay to do so by removing him from the proper context of his times or to pretend that he could do no wrong. Those readers who own a copy of any of Donald's other books will certainly want this as a companion volume.

review/summary: Not your ordinary Lincoln biography
review/text: According to the author's Preface, the publisher originally wanted to title this work "Chips from a Historian's Workbench." While awkward, that title was certainly perceptive. This book takes research that perhaps never found a place in other papers or books about Lincoln and uses it to show us a different way to see him and the events leading to the Civil War.This book contains numerous interesting bits of information about Lincoln although the one piece I found most interesting was the fact that Lincoln was a land surveyor for a time. Many writers focus on Lincoln's limited education but a surveyor must have a good understanding of mathematics and by most accounts, Lincoln was very competent. This brings to issue the long standing belief that Lincoln had little formal education but,according to the author, Lincoln's formal education was consistant with that received by young people at that time.There are some sections of this book where Lincoln's name fails to appear and the reader might have cause to wonder if he is reading the wrong book. Fortunately, these little detours are not only interesting but help us see Lincoln and the Civil War period from a new perspective.I found this short book (about 200 pages) to be interesting and engaging. It was written by an author who understands how to communicate and keep the reader's interest. I would recommend it to anyone having an interest in Lincoln or the Civil War.

review/summary: Reconsidering Lincoln...
review/text: Famous Lincoln scholar David Herbert Donald first wrote this collection essays as he was preparing his monumental biography of Abraham Lincoln, decades ago. The collection, periodically updated and reprinted, hold up pretty well as an antidote to Lincoln the myth, offering instead Lincoln the man of flesh and blood.Many of the myths with which Donald does battle are still prevalent, and his thoughtful essays provide insight and context on a remarkable man, raised on the American frontier and largely self-made, who became a successful lawyer, politician, and wartime president. Donald discusses Lincoln's background, education, his Whig politican background, and the adroit way in which he managed his administration during the Civil War. Among the touchy issues are Lincoln's handling of the Emancipation Proclomation and his selective curbing of civil war during the rebellion. Donald acknowledges many contradictions, but offers some pathways to understanding a complex man whose life has been distorted by both historians and more recent politicians; highly recommended to students of Lincoln and of the Civil War.

review/summary: Lincoln in a new light
review/text: "Lincoln Reconsidered" by David Donald 1961History has always been an interest for me. This takes a bit of time and expands on it very nicely. It starts out with a nice introdution about Lincoln and his times, the people he knew and worked with, then goes onto the politics and war. It had some anecdotes that you never see anywhere else. It turns out that Linoln was not a rabid emancipationist, but a pratical president who did things as needed to be done. I wondered before why he only freed the slaves in the states in rebellion: it was because he did not want to alienate the slaveholders in Kentucky and Maryland. I am still mystified as to the reason for the war of northern aggression: slavery does not seem to be the all inclusive answer that mythology makes it out to be, and this book shows some altenative reasons, but does not take a stand, after it is only a collection of essays.

review/summary: Explains why economics and politics don't mix!
review/text: Hazlitt's view is simple: economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time. He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace.

review/text: This book was written in the 1940s, so you have to take the examples as they are written for that era (i.e., railroads, radios, etc.) and equate them to modern technology. Nevertheless, the SOLID economic lessons in this book can not be refuted.All Liberals should read this book and rethink their twisted outlook on life and economics. This book is definitely NOT, "from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs", or to quote our current fearless leader, "we need to spread the wealth around."The book gives real world examples to illustrate its points. Everyone should read this book, especially high school children, before they become brainwashed by the far-left and the unions in this country.

review/summary: Want to learn Economics start with this book!
review/text: When I lost my job 3 years ago I wanted to know why! Why have I been financially set back twenty five years? Why the harder I worked, the more hours I put in the more the state and federal government took away from me.What was wrong with the American dream?I started my journey to learn economics with this book and when I finished each chapter the angrier I got... By the time I finished it I was furious. See I learned that Government was the blame for all this financial misery. Government bureaucrats and politicians who are economic ignoramuses making legislation and regulation who don't take into consideration the long term ramifications of these laws in destroying our nation's economy. This has been in the making for the last one hundred years until we have reached the point we are now.And what do we have now? We have a Central Planed Socialist nightmare that has eaten away the free market to the point where it is almost unrecognizable in this country.This is what the great Austrian Economists have warned us about."Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt is simply brilliant! It's the place to start. A very easy read, easy to understand and guaranteed to give you the ability to see easily what's currently going on and how these bad governmental decisions lead us to ruin.Once you finish this book and you crave more... I suggest F.A. Hayek "The Road to Serfdom" and also check out the Ludwig von Mises Institute on line... They have a great website with audio lessons available.If you have a deep passion for this nation, I can't stress more on spreading the word about fine books like this one. The more people that learn these simple economic lessons, the better the chance we can change the course of this nation and hopefully return to a land of prosperity for our future generations.

review/summary: The criticisms of this book are flawed
review/text: Rather than explaining why this is a good book (other revierw's do that), I'll explain why some of the idiotic criticisms levied against this book are wrong.The most silly criticism of Hazlitt (and other Austrian free-market economists) is that they aren't &quot;scientific&quot; and in short &quot;don't use enough math&quot;. This is an absurd criticism. Firstly, human beings are not deterministic particles who's behaviour can be predicted by simple equations. Any attempt to reduce human behaviour to some mathematical equation is pure non-sense. We must consider human beings as individual entities who can choose, not fixed constants in mathematical formuli.Secondly, there is a mathematics that is relevant to Austrians. It is chaos theory and network theory. Chaos theory is currently used to predict the weather. The calculus used by Keynes and other idiots like him is completely useless for describing the behaviour of chaotic systems where individual choice is involved. Hazlitt may not mention Chaos Theory. For that, see Murray N. Rothbard, &quot;Choas Theory: Destroying Mathematics from Within?&quot;; and Gene Callahan, &quot;Why Austrians Should Care About Network Science&quot;. Anyone with any sympathy for Keynes and his idiotic followers should note that Keynes put forth a &quot;treatise&quot; before General Theory, which was demolished by Hayek. Hayek then made a strategical mistake in not demolishing General Theory, feeling that the book's idiocy stood for itself. Also note that while Hayek recieved a Nobel Prize for work which was basically an extension of Mises business cycle theory (Mises died the year before Hayek's Nobel), Keynes received no Nobel, showing that even the dimwits awarding that title realized Keynes work was inherently worthless.The next criticism is related to the first: that Hazlitt doesn't discuss game theory. The reason for this is that game theory is particularly unworthy of discussion. Nash, founder of Game Theory, showed that in any finite game, there's an equilibrium in which no player can improve his or her outcome given the other player's strategies (the Nash Equilibrium). This is problematic in several ways. Firstly, there is absolutely no relation between the playing of games (which are less than net-zero, with one winner and one or more losers) and economics. Secondly, only Game Therorists behave in real situations in the ways in which Game Theory predicts. Thirdly, strategies are not data, but choices. Fourth, it is possible to break out of the specified game to achieve a superior result.One particularly ignorant reviewer says that in a completely unhampered free market, monopolies form, destroying competition. This is non-sense. Empirically, Ancient Ireland was a completely Stateless society for a thousand years, with a completely unhampered free market, and no-such thing occured. And of course it is a bunch of non-sense that can't happen in reality anyeways. A monopoly is only harmful if you have monopoly prices. But in a completely free market, even if someone obtains 100% of all (say) rail-roads, there is still competition between that form of transportation and other forms, thus monopoly prices cannot be charged. The only time real monopolies with monopoly pricing have emerged is because of State interference.This may not be the best book on economics that you can read (look to Mises' &quot;Human Action&quot; for what is most likely the strongest treatise on &quot;economics&quot; [actually praxeology, a much larger field]) ever written.

review/text: This is, in my opinion, the most important introduction to economics ever written. I began to read with some doubt that it could be of any interest. It not only captured my interest but set me on a path of new discovery making a subject I formerly considered so much witchcraft into a subject that permeates virtually every aspect of our lives. It is the founding theory that can make us a truly free people or enslaved to economic failures.No other book has dispelled the myths and fallacies that have plagued economic study like this one.It is a book for every citizen before he votes or runs for even the office of dog-catcher. Read and follow it with Hayek'sThe Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents--The Definitive Edition (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek)for even greater understanding.

review/summary: In Defense of the Free Market Economy
review/text: Henry Hazlitt provides the simple lesson in one short chapter, then uses the rest of this book to support this lesson. The result is a remarkably pragmatic and groundbreaking treatise in economic theory that anyone will find understandable and compelling.Strangely enough, when I was getting my B.A. in Economics from an institution of higher learning called Rockford College (Class of '74), I was never introduced to the works of Henry Hazlitt; it's too bad, getting that degree would've been so much easier.Now, thirty-five years later, stumbling upon Amazon's recommendations for me, I finally grabbed this book; better late than never.The past year or so, thanks in large part to the worst financial crisis since The Great Depression, the subject of economic theory has been hot. People want to know what went wrong. As Guy Sorman concludes in his marvelous book,Economics Does Not Lie: A Defense of the Free Market in a Time of Crisis, what went wrong is the ill-advised government intervention---not just in America, but globally. Governments rarely get it right when they try to intervene; their short-term fixes usually have long-term negative ramifications.The free market economy is what lured Russia into ending the Cold War twenty years ago. It helped 800 million Chinese greatly improve their economic well-being, as well. A return to a free market economy is what's needed to help Obama Nation avoid the pitfalls of socialism, and restore this nation's economic prosperity.Let's hope the President picks up a copy of this book; very soon.

review/summary: Still relevant today -- unfortunately
review/text: From previous reviews, I was under the impression that the "one lesson" was essentially repeated throughout the book.This sounded rather tedious.I was pleasantly surprised that each chapter covers a different topic. The "one lesson" is broad enough that it covers pretty much any topic in economics, so the author is free to discuss a long list of subjects and applications.Despite being written decades ago, this book is (unfortunately) very timely. The blowout government spending of the last few years shows clearly that our society has forgotten much, perhaps most, of how economics works.The only drawback to the book is that its title implies it covers all of economics. I had expected a one-book summary of the entire science (micro to macro).Instead, the book's primary focus is on how government actions affect the economy. Granted, our government today interferes in almost every sector of the economy, so this makes the book more broadly relevant than the author probably would have liked.Still, the basics of micro economics are not really covered here. They should be sought elsewhere.

review/summary: a brilliant, well-written economics primer
review/text: Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the &quot;common good.&quot; However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand.

review/summary: A Good Read
review/text: This book is a fine introduction to how economic theory can dictate policies that promote the economic well being of society. The focus of the book is "The Law of Unintended Consequences", and the author brings in countless examples of how well meaning policies, such as price ceilings, rent control, etc have led to disastrous results.In giving it 4 stars instead of 5, I'd like to point out some concerns.1) The book, while a classic, is somewhat dated. The ideas are still pertinent, but many examples are not as relevant today.2) I'm afraid that reading Naked Economics first spoiled me a bit. This book lacked the humor and pep that kept me engrossed in the former.3) Most importantly, the book is strictly about economics, and is too simplistic in some ways. It fails to incorporate the complex real world political dynamics that determine policy. Today, most congressmen are sold on the benefits of free trade. But the barriers to economic growth are more nuanced in the real world.Some will argue that this was not the focus of the book, and they are correct. Still, I fear that a reader will latch onto Hazlitt's ideas as a panacea, and fail to appreciate that in a world where "Keeping up with the Joneses" is as important, if not more important, than how much wealth one has, that policy decisions are more complex that the author would have us believe.

review/summary: Don't buy the audio version from audible
review/text: Don't buy the audio version from audible.com .Their programming skills are terrible. I could not download some of the books I bought, could not burn into cd the ones I could download, and forget about making it work with an mp3 player, unless you're lucky.I know about 5 people who bought stuff from there and only one had the luck of downloading a working file and burning it successfully to a cd.The quality of the narrations is awful, at least in the books I managed to hear (only on windows media player, nothing else worked). If you're used to books on cd or tape, you're up for a big disappointment buying from audible.On top of all that, they have the worst customer service I have ever witnessed. The site was not working right when I tried to purchase there for the first time. I sent them a message with no answer.In a second attempt, I bought the stuff and some files never downloaded (which means they just stole my money and I don't know what I can do since I don't live in USA). I sent another message with no answer again.Then their weird program, which turns Windows Media Player automatically on instead of working alone, showed no compatibility to Itunes and no possibility of burning cds or dreaming about hearing books on Ipod. I sent them a third message and nothing. A fourth and guess what? Nothing again.So I am at least trying to warn other people here to avoid being caught by such scheme. I hope Amazon gets rid of audible as soon as possible. I always got great service from Amazon and the affiliated bookstores, or even other stores selling electronics, health products and others, but audible is just the worst company I ever wasted my money with. Too bad we cannot give notes to them like with the affiliated booksellers.Sorry by the poor text, I am just mad with them.

review/summary: Need More Than One Lesson
review/text: As Albert Einstein said, everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. Hazlitt makes a cogent argument that overall productivity in macro-markets is maximized by classical economic policies with an emphasis on unregulated markets. But on let us not get too easily carried away by this author's reduction.The global markets of our age are, after all, dominated by the great (and institutionally amoral) transnational corporations we've been effectively forced to know so well. Despite spectacular public relations, these have in many important way proved themselves untrustworthy as guardians and promoters of our collective interests.Robert Kuttner's "Everything For Sale," to give one example, provides excellent and badly needed counterbalance to Hazlitt's argument. Kuttner gives numerous examples of issues that most of us would consider very important (such as health and the environment) and goes into probing and very revealing detail on why and how so-called free markets simply fail.

review/summary: beware of free market economists bearing grifts
review/text: I understand the general euphoria over this book. It is well written, succinct and, in places, an accurate exegesis of free market economics. In much of the text, Hazlitt artfully debunks incorrect reasoning that often drives economic policy. Insofar as the book limits itself to that modest goal, it succeeds admirably. But when Hazlett more ambitiously attempts to purvey free market economics as singular truth the book falls painfully short.Hazlitt, like other free market economists, forgets that free market theory is only a pardigm. Free market thinking is useful to the extent that the conditions precedent to a free market are fulfilled; but no further. When the assumptions underlying free market thought are not met, the theory may fail. And in virtually ignoring this fact the book founders.For example, Hazlitt never mentions the problem of externalities which free markets inevitably fail to address. And his actors always conform to behavior convenient for free market theory. To paraphrase Garrison Keillor, Hazlett's universe is a paradise where all the markets are strong, all the investments are attractive and all the profits are above average.But there are other failings, too. The dislocations of a free market economy are generally trivialized. Unemployment is almost viewed as a benefit to workers when resultant from free market operations; as if a pink slip were a toll pass for the Yellow Brick Road leading to the Oz of more efficient employment. In several places Hazlitt is inconsistent, as when discussing the failure of marginal producers (a benefit when caused by free market processes in declining industries; an evil when caused by "excessive" wage demands by labor). Remarkably, he adverts to the "inappropriate" political power wielded by labor and farmers due to their disproportionate numbers, while never mentioning the truly undue influence that corporate largesse has on governing institutions. What Hazlett considers improper political influence most of us would consider functioning democracy.In summary, this book is a useful and brief introduction to free market economics. So long as one recognizes its limitations, well . . .no harm, no foul. But for true economic enlightenment you will have to look elsewhere.
